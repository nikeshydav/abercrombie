<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong>  11 Nights</p>
<p>Enjoy Alaska's largest city - Anchorage. Experience dogsledding and enjoy fantastic opportunities to bear watch.</p>

</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>London/Anchorage</h5>
<p>On arrival into Anchorage airport, your driver will take you to Girdwood. This 45-minute drive to the Hotel Alyeska resort, along the Turnagain Arm of Cook Inlet, is one of the world's great drives. The 127-mile Seward Highway is recognized for its scenic, natural, historical wonders.</p>

</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Heli Glacier Dog Sledding</h5>
<p>Head out on your first Alaskan Adventure - Helicopter-supported dogsledding. This is the quintessential Alaskan experience. Stop at the homestead of 4-Time Iditarod Champion Martin Buser for a private visit with his more than 60 dogs and extensive collection of Alaskan artifacts. Martin guided each of the four Iditarod champion teams and is always a favourite for the title. His previous wins were in 1992, 1994, 1997 and 2002.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>Denali National Park</h5>
<p>The wilderness backcountry of the Denali National Park supports big game species such as black bear, grizzly and moose. Forests and high alpine tundra are also home to porcupine, marmots and beavers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4-5</h4>
<h5>Activities within Denali National Park</h5>
<p>Today choose from a range of extraordinary activities available at North Face Lodge - biking along the park road on an independent adventure; fishing in Moose Creek for Arctic Grayling or Wonder Lake for Mackinaw Trout; or paddling a Canoe as you trace "Denali's" reflection in Wonder Lake.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6-7</h4>
<h5> Tutka Bay </h5>
<p>This morning, meet your pilot for your scenic flight to Anchorage. Fly along Mt. McKinley and the awe-inspiring Alaska Range to the North Face of Denali and over a number of the north side glaciers. Tutka Bay is a splendidly rugged fjord that reaches six miles into the glacier-studded Kenai Mountains. Your lodge is situated on ten acres and includes six guest cabins, main lodge, and a large viewing deck with sauna and hot-tub.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 8</h4>
<h5>Redoubt Bay</h5>
<p>This morning, after breakfast, you will board your float plane for a scenic 60 minute flight to Redoubt Bay Bear Sanctuary. The Redoubt Bay Lodge is a prime location for watching brown bears as it has one of the densest bear populations in the state. You will have the opportunity to see bears up close as they come down to the lake to fish for salmon.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 9-10</h4>
<h5> Winterlake Lodge</h5>
<p>We have planned a day of adventure via helicopter into the pristine wilderness surrounding Winterlake Lodge. In consultation with the Lodge hosts, you are able to make your own detailed itinerary of your exploration into the backcountry.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 11</h4>
<h5> Winterlake Lodge</h5>
<p>Today enjoy a morning of relaxation or choose a lodge-based activity. After lunch, board your float plane bound for Anchorage, where your driver will take you to the Hotel Captain Cook for the evening.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 12</h4>
<h5> Anchorage</h5>
<p>Your driver will meet you this morning in the hotel lobby to drive you to the Anchorage Airport in plenty of time for your departure flight.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

Rhinos can be seen with calves at heel. Eland and waterbuck appear not to notice the human visitors, enabling photographers to shoot at ease. On the lake in the middle of the crater you may see thousands of flamingos, fluttering and shimmering like a pink heat haze.

<p><strong>overnight:</strong> Hotel Alyeska</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Kenai Peninsula</h5>
<p>Visit the Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center en route to the Kenai River. This nonprofit organization rehabilitates injured or orphaned animals and returns them to the wild. During your visit, you may see local wildlife, including bears, moose, bison, elk and a variety of birds. This afternoon, take a float trip through Kenai National Wildlife Refuge.

<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B L D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>Kenai Peninsula</h5>
<p>Cruise the Kenai Fjords National Park, and witness the crash of calving glaciers. The park occupies more than half a million acres and is covered by an ice pack extending more than 700 square miles. You may see humpback whales, orcas, puffins and sea lions at close range; look to the skies for a glimpse of bald eagles overhead. Ride the double-decker Alaska Railroad GoldStar Dome train, which is adorned with original Alaskan art and features an upper-level, open-air platform and a glass-covered observation deck offering sensational views of the countryside.</p>

Afterward, enjoy a riverside picnic lunch to take in the beauty of the surrounding landscapes. Although you may not rake in as many fish as the bears you saw yesterday did, with the supplied fishing equipment - tackle, boots and rain gear - you should have a very rewarding morning nonetheless. This afternoon, go on a geocaching adventure, a high-tech treasure hunt using handheld GPS devices, on the grounds of your lodge.
</p>
<p> <strong>Overnight:</strong> Talkeetna Alaskan Lodge <br /> 
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B L</p>

This afternoon, you may explore the quaint downtown of Talkeetna, a three-square-block area centered on the Village Park; 13 of its buildings are on the National Register of Historic Places. Step out to the banks of the Talkeetna River to look for wildlife and enjoy spectacular views of Mount McKinley and the Alaska Range. You may also visit Denali National Park's Talkeetna Ranger Station, the last stop for climbing expeditions headed up Mount McKinley.</p>
<p> <strong>Overnight:</strong> Talkeetna Alaskan Lodge <br /> 
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B L</p>
</li>

Your pilot, linked to you by two-way headset throughout the flight, explains the highlights you see. Land on a glacier's surface, and disembark to experience the majesty of Alaska's beauty, with snow-veiled peaks surrounding a vast snowfield stretching in every direction. This afternoon, meet and have lunch with four-time Iditarod champion Martin Buser, and meet his Alaskan husky team.<p>
<p>Continue to Anchorage and enjoy a brief city tour, including the downtown district, and a demonstration of the traditional Alaska Ulus. Celebrate your Alaskan adventure at a farewell dinner tonight.</p>

<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 10 Nights</p>

<p><strong>Highlights:</strong>- Experience the dramatic sounds of the glacier 'calving'<br />
- Visit Alaska's oldest and most scenic towns<br />
- Cruise Inside Passage<br />
- Vancouver with its stunning skyline</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>UK/Anchorage</h5>
<p>Depart the UK for Alaska flying via Seattle. Spend your first Alaskan night in one of the state's best properties, The Captain Cook Hotel, or add on some additional days to explore this wonderful and varied city.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Embark Seward</h5>
<p>Seward is one of Alaska's oldest and most scenic towns. One of the Kenai Peninsula's major communities, it lies at the south end of theSeward Highway. It's also the jumping off point for your luxury Alaskan cruise aboard the Silver Shadow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5> Cruising the Hubbard Glacier</h5>
<p>Advancing 7 feet a day, the Hubbard Glacier is an awe-inspiring highlight on this cruise. Experiencing the dramatic sounds of the glacier 'calving' (breaking apart and crashing into the icy sea) during your voyage will be unforgettable. The ship will venture close to the glacier itself where you experience the blue intensity of the ice. Unbelievably, it takes around 400 years for the ice to traverse the length of the glacier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5> Sitka</h5>
<p>Only the smallest excursion vessels can dock at Sitka. This small town is sandwiched between high mountains and the Pacific Ocean. It's hard not to like Sitka, with its eclectic blend of native, Russian, and American history and its dramatic and beautiful setting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>Cruising Tracyarm/Sawyer Glacier/Juneau</h5>
<p>Squeezed between glacier-carved walls nearly 3000 feet high, Tracyarm Fjord is spectacular. Literally hundreds of waterfalls cascade down the sides of the fjord. Giant sections of ice break off and tumble into the freezing waters. It's a magical and unforgettable experience. Juneau, Alaska's capital and third-largest city, is on the North American mainland but can't be reached by road. Its dramatic hillside position and historic buildings provide an unusual frontier feeling, but the city's cosmopolitan nature comes through in its fine museums and noteworthy restaurants. In addition to enjoying the city itself, take the tramway to the alpine trails at the summit of Mt.Roberts. The Juneau area offers densely forested wilderness areas, quiet bays for sea kayaking and excellent wildlife spotting opportunities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>Skagway</h5>
<p>This seaport sits on a deepwater fjord, the Taiya Inlet, at the head of Lynn Canal, which stretches 90 miles from Juneau between banks that seem untouched by human hands. Skagway is perhaps the easiest port in Alaska to explore on foot. Spend the day exploring the wilderness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5> Ketchikan</h5>
<p>Known for its colourful totem poles, rainy skies, steep streets, and lush island setting, Ketchikan is a favourite stop for travellers on this cruise. Seaplanes depart for Misty Fjords, and commercial fishing boats laden with salmon head home to Tongass Narrows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 8</h4>
<h5>Cruising the Inside Passage</h5>
<p>The famed Inside Passage is another much anticipated adventure. The sealife here is abundant. Look out for humpback whales spouting, seals, bears, sea otters and bald eagles buzzing overhead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 9</h4>
<h5>Vancouver</h5>
<p>The final day of your cruise arrives into the vibrant Canadian city of Vancouver with its stunning skyline and bustling harbour. We'd recommend extra time in this area to explore Whistler, Victoria Island and perhaps one of our specially chosen wilderness resorts for more close up wildlife watching opportunities.</p>

Visit the adjacent Maasai village, take a morning bush walk with an armed ranger or enjoy sundowners in the evening or even dinner under the stars in the middle of the African bush.<br /><br />In the Mara, the wildlife is abundant and the swaying grasslands ensure that animals are never out of sight. Elephants browse amongst the large herds of wildebeest, topi, gazelle, eland and buffalo. The plains offer a rich variety of food for the dominant predators: lion, leopard, hyena and cheetah. In the Mara River, hippos submerge while crocodiles sunbathe on the riverbanks.<br /><br />Around July to September, rain depending, the Masai Mara is host to the famous wildebeest migration which is one of the few remaining mass migrations of mammals in the world. During this time herds of over a million wildebeest will trawl their way through this region and they become the major focus for predatory activity and drama unfolds at every corner.<br /><br />There are also options for a morning balloon safari or a half-day visit to Lake Victoria.<br /><br />Balloon Safari: As the balloon is inflated against the first rays of sunrise your pilot will go through safety procedures. Once aloft, the balloon floats gently over the plains, giving a bird's eye view of the game below as the sun creeps slowly over the horizon. After around one hour the balloon lands as breakfast is already being prepared and, of course, enjoy a glass or two of bubbly to toast your flight in a tradition initiated by the Montgolfier brothers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lake Victoria Adventure : An early start this morning with a transfer to the airstrip for a flight by light aircraft to Lake Victoria. On arrival enjoy an appetising full English breakfast before you board the boat for the morning. There will be the opportunity to try fishing for the legendary giant Nile perch found in these waters as you explore the myriad of tiny islands in this region of the lake. An experienced and knowledgeable fisherman captains each boat.

This afternoon explore the Selous either by foot on a walking safari, by boat on the Rufiji and Lake Tagala, or in open 4WD vehicles. All excursions are escorted by an experienced armed guide.<br /><br />Selous Sand Rivers is situated on the banks of the Rufiji River, offering a unique combination of adventure, comfort and exclusivity. This small luxury lodge, crafted out of local materials, comprises six individually designed cottages with en-suite bathrooms. Spaced along the river bank, each has its own private view of the wide sand-banked river with its hippos, crocodiles and birdlife. Near the dining area a large baobab tree shades the swimming pool in which guests can escape the heat of the sun or cool off after a game walk.<br /></p>";

Enjoy the solitude whilst observing elephants, lions, buffalo, hippos and crocodiles. Game drives are conducted by 4WD vehicles or from your river boat, the more adventurous of you may like to stretch your legs with a walking safari.<br /><br />The Selous Game Reserve is the largest game reserve in the world and has some of the finest virgin bush left in Africa, where the last of the really big-tusked elephants and large-maned lions roam. The Selous supports around one million game animals, is bigger than Switzerland and is a World Heritage site. From March to May floods sweep the valley, forcing the game on to the 'islands' of higher ground, where elephant, buffalo, lion, leopard, crocodile, puku, buck, eland, sable and others concentrate.<br /></p>";

Alternatively you may like to relax at your camp with a book on your private verandah or cool off in the camp's pool.<br /><br />The Selous is Africa's largest wildlife sanctuary and one of its least known treasures. Covering 21,000 square miles of completely undeveloped land, the Selous is one of the last great tracts of true wilderness left in Africa.<br /></p>";

Transfer from Arusha to Ngorongoro Crater Lodge located on the rim with spectacular views across the crater. The Ngorongoro Crater is the largest unbroken caldera in the world and the first sight of it is breathtaking.<br /><br />Ngorongoro Crater Lodge is situated on the edge of the ancient crater rim above the cool, swirling mists. The lodge is a return to the noble elegance of the travelling colonials. Inspired in design by the Maasai Manyatta, three separate camps of 6 to 12 suites each remember a bygone era when characters such as Lord Delamere adorned the stilted, handcrafted structures with graceful antiques, grand chandeliers and treasures collected from travels through Africa.<br /><br /></p>";

Enjoy a picnic lunch amongst the hippos and birds before visiting a Maasai village this afternoon.<br /><br />The floor of the crater is only 100 sq miles but is home to around 30,000 animals with a high concentration of predators and some of the finest black-maned lions in Africa. Rhinos can often be seen with calves at heel. Eland and waterbuck appear not to notice the human visitors, enabling photographers to shoot at ease. On the lake in the middle of the crater you may see thousands of flamingos fluttering and shimmering like a pink heat haze. Zebra and wildebeest account for almost half the animals. Gazelle, buffalo, eland, hartebeest and wart hog can also be seen.<br /></p>";

The camp offers spectacular views across Tortillis woodland situated on the edge of the short grass plains. The camp is comprised of nine double tents scattered around the kopje with the mess tent and common area as the central feature.
