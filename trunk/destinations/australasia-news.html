<h3><strong style="text-decoration:underline;">Dining in The Woods</strong></h3>
<p>The Woods, Four Seasons Hotel Sydney's adventurous new dining destination has thrown open its doors, paving the way for a new generation of hotel dining in Australia! </p> 
<p>
Sporting a chic contemporary yet rustic appearance, this stunning ground floor restaurant's ethos revolves around wood-fired cooking with Hamish Ingham at the helm as Restaurant Executive Chef. He is supported by his restaurateur partner Rebecca Lines who is overseeing The Woods' management.</p>
<p>
Created by award-winning designer, Michael McCann, The Woods draws in guests with its spectacular centrally located wood-fired oven and open-plan kitchen complete with wood-fired grill. Ingham sources fresh, home-grown produce which is cooked over a variety of naturally-flavoured Australian woods including apple wood, mushroom and mallee stumps.</p>
<p>
The wow factors include a creative live vertical herb wall which forms the backdrop to the chef's table, a hand-hewn butcher's block to display the home-made bread and butter, and a dramatic black and white cow hide wall hanging, which frames the open-plan cold kitchen.</p>
<p>
Guests can have a taste of The Woods at the restaurant's bar on entry which offers its own lighter menu, or go deeper into The Woods for the experience of a semi-private dining room which even has its own separate entry path, ideal for larger bookings and functions. </p>
<p>
Ingham's philosophy for The Woods is very much about the art of simplicity.  He showcases the purest ingredients in a light, fresh, balanced way using the evocative nature of burning wood.</p>

<h3><strong style="text-decoration:underline;">Lake Eyre in flood</strong></h3>
<p>Now is the time to view Australia's largest salt lake, which is located 647 km north east of Adelaide in South Australia. Witnessing parts of the lake in full flood, is normally a 'once in a lifetime' occurrence, however due to the large amount of rain that has been flowing into the lake from the 1 million square kilometre Lake Eyre basin, parts of the lake currently remain spectacularly in flood for the third year running. The lake itself actually comprises of 2 lakes - Lake Eyre North & Lake Eyre South.</p>
<p>
The sheer size of the lake with its stunning range of colours is best viewed from the air onboard a private flight with expert pilot/guide. From the comfort of the aircraft, fly low over the green grass, pink algae in the lake, white salt on the Northern section of the lake and blue water in Belt Bay. Not only do you see the lake but the full day private scenic flight will take you over the multi-layered ancient landscape of the Flinders Ranges home of the strangely beautiful natural amphitheatre of Wilpena Pound. The tour will also visit Coopers Creek & the legendary Birdsville Track - a former stock route which cuts it way through the outback and stretches for 517km.</p>
<p>
Land at William Creek a tiny outback town with only 3 permanent residents and a dog! Step into the outback William Creek Hotel to try some delicious Aussie pub fare. Conclude the tour with a fly over the Anna Creek Station - the same size of Wales and proudly the largest cattle station in the World!</p>
<p>
This remarkable day tour departs from Adelaide and is seasonal depending on the flood waters.</p>
<p>
Please speak to an A&K Travel Specialist for further details and pricing.</p>

<h3><strong style="text-decoration:underline;">Saffire wins Architecture and Travel Accolades</strong></h3>
<p>World Architecture News, a website for the global architectural community, has awarded Saffire Freycinet on Tasmania's east coast as winner of the Hotel of the Year 2011.</p>
<p>The stunning design of this luxury coastal sanctuary by Circa Architecture impressed the judges for capturing the essence of the unique region.</p>
<p>Saffire also recently won a coveted Australian Gourmet Traveller Magazine Travel Award for 'Best New Hotel, Resort or Lodge 2011'. Saffire came runner-up in the 'Best Hotel or Resort Dining 2011' category as well.</p>
<p>"That show stopping view across Great Oyster Bay to the granite hulk of the Hazards and beyond is enough to arouse wanderlust in the most sensible of souls. Dream location aside, Saffire's other strong qualities are its size - just 20 luxurious suites among the peppermint gums - and sweeping architecture." - Australian Gourmet Traveller Magazine.
</p>
<p>Also in Tasmania - MONA, Museum of Old and New Art was awarded Standout Australian Travel Experience -
"Hobart millionaire David Walsh, iconoclastic owner of the Museum of Old and New Art, successfully dazzles and defies the conventions of gallery going with his fantastic new museum on the fringe of the Tasmanian capital. The Fender Katsalidis-designed fortress of rusted steel fused onto primitive sandstone feels like a metaphor for Walsh's eclectic private art collection (reputedly the nation's largest) that marries ancient artifacts with bracingly modern installations. So keenly awaited and so feverishly hyped, since opening in January MONA has proved itself to be that rare commodity among Australian attractions = an instant success, an international drawcard and a growing source of national pride." - Australian Gourmet Traveller Magazine.</p>

<p>At this time we think of our friends, suppliers and guides in the region and send our thoughts and support to them.

Monies raised will be used to help the communities, families and people of Christchurch and the Canterbury region.</p>
<p>We are currently advising clients not to travel to Christchurch for the next month or so, however the rest of New Zealand is fully operational with no road closures and all airports being open.</p>
