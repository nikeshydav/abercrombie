<dt><h2>Yangon</h2> 
<p>Capital city of Myanmar-Yangon is a yesteryear world within itself. Unlike any other Asian city, Yangon has an earthy charm which transports you back in time. With foreign investment in minimal quantity, Yangon will remind you of its colonial past. Almost nothing has changed except that the city has puckered up some good infrastructural units for its visitors. So in all, the city has that eclectic touch of the yesteryear.</p>
<div class="thepet"><p>Called the 'Garden City of the East', Yangon has an amazing collection of lakes, lush green parks and tropical trees which gives it a different visual appeal. The city holds back to its signature look with common display of cobbled streets, unpainted houses, moss covered buildings and more. The never-ending roads and the un-kept look of the town helps a great deal in making the city what it is right now. All this will take you back in the time when industrialisation had not swept Asia. Take a stroll in the busy streets of Yangon while picking up something from their market place, sip a Burmese tea and enjoy the mild climate. A safe place to hang around, Yangon also has the famous Shwedagon Pagoda which is built at an elevated level and is visible from every road turn. </p>

<dt><h2>Mandalay</h2> 
<p>Rudyard Kipling in his appraisal of Mandalay had written 'The Road to Mandalay' with a few words resounding like: "For the wind is in the palm trees, and the temple-bells they say: Come you back, you British soldier; come you back to Mandalay."<br />
</p>
<div class="thepet"><p>These words capture the essence of the city with élan as it remains as the last royal capital of the Burmese kingdom. Striding with composure, this city has geographically been placed at the core centre of the country. Established as a centre for the study of Buddhism, Mandalay had its foundation stone put forth by King Mindon. Furthering the tradition of being the religious centre, it is today the spiritual hub of the country with more than half of the total monks in Myanmar residing here. </p>
<p>Associated with pride and nostalgia of having been the seat of the crown, Mandalay has a touch of grace and romance to it. Being on the royal stamp for 150 years, the city was christened a very lyrical and flowy name. The mysticism of the Orient and the wisdom of the years gives Mandalay a way about itself. Amidst all this, it manages to balance the common life with bustling streets, dusty and busy giving way to horse-driven carts and rickshaws. The Irrawaddy flows peacefully in the city while you must also get a peek-a-boo into Sagaing, a lost city. Former capital of the once-independent Shan kingdom, Sagaing sits on a small hill. Another must visit is the former royal capital, Amarapura (known as 'city of immortality').

<dt><h2>Bagan</h2> 
<p>Bagan was called Pagan in the earlier times and is today a city which boasts of four million Pagodas. It is ofcourse the hub of Pagodas and this tradition continues from the time it became the first capital city of a then-mighty Bamar kingdom. It is understood that Bagan was born out of 19 villages.</p>
<div class="thepet"><p> 
Bagan lived its Golden Era from 1044 to 1287 when almost the exact number of thirteen kings had built a huge number of temples, pagodas, palaces in continuation and succession. Also, Theravada Buddhism was introduced to the city during this time. The great marathon of civilisations ended in a scuffle when Genghis Khan's grandson, Kublai Khan held the city by his boots. An enigmatic panorama of events can unfold in front of you if you choose to see them at Bagan. To add, this city bags very little tourist-attention while its illustrated cousin, Angkor Wat takes it all. So, you could be different this time around.

<dt><h2>Inle Lake</h2> 
<p>Lying on the borderline with Thailand, Laos and China, Inle Lake has that secrecy that asks you to keep it intact with you. Just like you experience magic, the hills that surround this region in the east of Myanmar (southern Shan state) bring the true character of the area to its visitors within a few minutes of travel. </p>
<div class="thepet"><p>Inle Lake is fitted between the folds of two hills which dominantly stare at each side of the shore. The Intha people (as they are called) reside in small villages scattered along the lakeside and the islands. Over one hundred monasteries and a thousand pagodas brighten the Lake's shoreline. If you are looking for a quiet and peaceful holiday, make sure to visit the area surrounding the Lake. Boasting of a clear sky, lush greenery, nature's bountiful, pristine water and a proper homecoming by its inhabitants; you would feel at home here. Romanticise or go on a spiritual journey by hopping onto one of the canoes on the floating gardens, watching the sun go down across a clear sky, fishing the unique Burmese way or just enjoying a peaceful evening away from the madness of the world. </p>

<dt><h2>Mrauk Oo</h2> 
<p>As different as its name, this ancient city of western Myanmar holds the gate to the country's past. Bordering with Bangladesh, this city served as the capital city of Rakhine state from 1430 to 1784. During its heydays, the city had trading contacts with far-off states like Portugal, Spain, Holland and the Middle East.</p>
<div class="thepet"><p>Secluded from the world, MraukOo sees very few tourists, leaving it untouched and pure. It is often referred to as the 'new Bagan' but has lesser visual appeal than the latter. Blessed with a clear landscape, carefully laid down farms and a lining of ancient architecture-temples and pagodas; MraukOo is a true delight for visitors. </p>
<p>Walking up towards the north is the Lemro River where you would locate a few Chin tribal villages. A further walk will take you up to the Chin Hills characterised by beautifully entailed descriptions of nature. You will see farmers working on their lands while bamboo sellers carrying their daily bread downstream to Sittwe. Come and get fascinated by the typical Chin hill village here where ladies have their faces tattooed. Though, this tradition is seeing a gradual death with more young girls opting out of it.

<dt><h2>Keng Tung</h2> 
<p>Different from the rest of Myanmar culturally, Keng Tung has its affliction to traditional space with Laos and Thailand (due to its proximity). Sitting between Thanlwin River in Myanmar and the Mekong on the border of the trio-Thai, Laos and Myanmar, a mountain range cuts Keng Tong to give it a stronger tie with its neighbours.</p>
<div class="thepet"><p>A backwater town that is lazy and slow in its approach, Keng Tung makes for a great visit if you want a holiday to relax. Within close distance to the infamous Golden Triangle, known for its opium production and smuggling; Keng Tung makes for a getaway from worldly troubles. It looks like a picture painted on a postcard with serene hills and pure water flowing around it. Situated in a valley, get your spiritual connect stronger encircled around hill tribes and ethnic minorities. Keng Tung is a true South East Asian delight and you must visit the place for its preserved tribes. </p>
