<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong>  7 days  </p>
<p>Discover the capital of England as well as the revered cities of Bath and Oxford</p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong> London, Bath, Oxford</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>Arrive Edinburgh</h5>
<p>Upon arrival at Edinburgh airport you will be met in the arrivals hall by your local representative and privately transferred to your hotel. Your representative will assist you with check-in procedures.</p>
<p> <strong>Overnight:</strong> Balmoral Hotel</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Edinburgh</h5>
<p>This morning, you will meet an expert local guide for a full day sightseeing tour of Scotland's capital city by private vehicle. You will first head up to Edinburgh Castle, where you will see the 'Honours of Scotland', the Scottish Crown Jewels, and obtain stunning views of the city. You will then continue down the Royal Mile, past St. Giles High Kirk, to Holyrood Palace, the Queen's official residence in Scotland. You will tour the staterooms of the palace if no member of the Royal Family is staying here at the time.</p>
 <p>
This afternoon, start by visiting the National Gallery of Scotland where a curator will take you on a tour of the highlights. Later you will drive down to the city docks at Leith, where you will board the former Royal Yacht Britannia, now permanently moored here, for a semi-private early evening tour. Built in Scotland, this ship was used by the Royal Family for many official voyages during her working life.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Balmoral Hotel
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>The Borders of Scotland</h5>
<p>You will meet your driver-guide who will take you on a full day excursion into the Scottish Borders in a vintage Rolls Royce or Daimler vehicle. The River Tweed, one of the finest salmon rivers in Britain, runs through this area of pleasant hills and rolling agricultural land. This is Walter Scott Country, and you will visit his house at Abbotsford. Still owned by his descendants, you can see where the novelist worked and look at some of his memorabilia. You will also visit the nearby woollen mill town of Melrose, site of one of the region's many ruined abbey churches.</p>
<p>
Later, you will visit Traquair House, the oldest inhabited house in Scotland.  Known for its gates that will remain shut until a member of the Stuart family sits again on the British throne, this house boasts its own brewery. On your return to Edinburgh you may also visit Rosslyn Chapel, this small but very ornately carved church has achieved fame recently as a location featured in 'The Da Vinci Code'.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Balmoral Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>Edinburgh - Perth - Fort William</h5>
<p>Your driver-guide will take you on a full day journey by private vehicle into the Highlands of Scotland.  You will make your first stop in Perth, where you will be able to visit Scone Palace, a mansion built on the site of the coronation of the medieval kings of Scotland. Continue north into the Scottish Highlands, and stop to visit the Edradour Scotch whisky distillery, the smallest in Scotland, where you will be treated to a tasting of various malts of different ages. Afterwards you will continue to your hotel in Fort William, one of the main towns in the region. You will be confirmed for 3 nights at Inverlochy Castle, the finest country house hotel in Scotland.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Inverlochy Castle<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>Loch Ness and the Great Glen</h5>
<p> Today you will see some of Scotland's best-known places on a full day journey to Fort William with your driver-guide and private vehicle.  Drive along the River Ness until you reach Loch Ness, home of the fabled monster. You can visit the ruins of Urquhart Castle that dominate the deepest part of the lake. If you prefer, why not take a privately-chartered cruise on a boat which has sonar equipment on board to scan for mysterious objects in the water.</p>
<p>
Continue to Inverness, where you will cross the battlefield of Culloden Moor, scene of the battle where Bonnie Prince Charlie was defeated in 1746 by government troops. On the return journey to Fort William, you may like to take the gondola up the Aonach Mor slope of Ben Nevis, Britain's highest mountain.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Inverlochy Castle
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>The Isle of Skye</h5>
<p>Your driver-guide will lead you on a full day excursion to the Isle of Skye. The route starts by heading northwest over the mountains to Glen Shiel, the valley that will lead you to the West Coast.  In Loch Duich, you will visit the romantic Eilean Donan Castle, pictured on many postcards from Scotland.</p>
<p>
You will then drive over the bridge to the Isle of Skye, where you will still see road signs in the Gaelic language. Weather permitting you will obtain fine views of the Cuillin Hills in the centre of the island. Pause to obtain a flavour of the Gaelic heritage at the Clan Donald Centre. Lunch may be taken at Kinloch Lodge, the restaurant owned by Lady Claire MacDonald, one of Scotland's leading cookery writers.</p>
<p>
Return to the mainland by the ferry to Mallaig, and drive along the 'Road to the Isles' that leads to Fort William. En route, you will pass the Glenfinnan monument, where Bonnie Price Charlie raised his standard in 1745.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Inverlochy Castle
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>

<li>
<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>Fort William - Loch Lomond and the Trossachs - Gleneagles</h5>
<p>You will leave your hotel this morning for a full day of touring with your driver-guide in a private vehicle. Drive along Glencoe, scene of the Campbell atrocity against the McDonalds, crossing the windswept Rannoch Moor, and following the road down to Crianlarich.</p>

<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>EXPLORE GEORGIAN BATH</h5>
<p> This morning you will take a walking tour with a local guide to explore the beautiful Georgian city of Bath, often regarded as one of the loveliest cities in all of England.</p>
<p>From its beginnings as a Roman camp in the first century AD, Bath developed through troubled centuries to emerge in the 1700's as a fashionable "spa" resort. Some of England's best-preserved Georgian architecture is housed here, together with fascinating relics of earlier eras.

<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>BATH-STONEHENGE-COTSWOLDS</h5>
<p>You will be joined this morning by a guide for a tour by private vehicle across the English countryside. You will head first to Salisbury, stopping to admire the thirteenth-century cathedral that boasts the highest medieval spire in England and also to visit the Chapter House, to see the best preserved of the four surviving original copies of the Magna Carta. Continue afterwards past the hill of Old Sarum on your way up to the Salisbury Plain. Here you will visit Stonehenge, arguably the most famous prehistoric site in Europe, it inspires wonder at the effort it must have taken to drag the enormous stones over the land and erect them in circles.</p>
<p>From here, drive north into the Cotswold Hills to reach Little Faringdon House, the country house reserved exclusively for you for the next 4 nights. You are welcomed by the house staff, and this evening you will be served dinner in the elegant dining room.</p>

</p>
<p>The first day will be spent exploring Lechlade, a bustling little town where Kelmscott Manor can be found, an old Cotswold manor house that was owned by William Morris, the founder of the 19th century Arts & Crafts movement. Situated on the south side of the Thames is a delightful example of a neo-classical country mansion, Buscot Park, interestingly once home to Lord Faringdon and a fantastic series of murals painstakingly produced by the Pre-Raphaelite painter Edward Burne-Jones. Before heading back to your own country pad why not hire a boat on the River Thames?</p>

<p>From here head to the chocolate box village of Bibury, one of the most photographed of all of the villages in England where quaint cottages, such as those in Arlington Row, date from the 14th century. Whilst exploring the pretty streets the local Trout Farm is well worth a visit and a stop off for afternoon tea next to the river shouldn't be missed.
</p>
<p>Prior to the evening meal why not explore the private parkland that belongs to the house, which includes ponds, a lake, an orchard and beautiful walks along the River Leach.</p>

<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>BURFORD &AMP; CIRENCESTER</h5>

Burford was voted the 6th most idyllic destination in Europe by Forbes in 2009. Burford High Street sweeps down the hill towards the River Windrush and is lined with many interesting shops, including antiques shops, where souvenirs can be purchased. One of the local pubs is a great spot to sample some local cuisine for your lunch prior to heading to the self-styled capital of the Cotswolds, Cirencester.
</p>
<p>Cirencester dates back to Roman times, local artifacts and mosaics from which can be found on display at the fascinating Corinium Museum. A great selection of elegant shops allows for another opportunity to pick up some souvenirs. Alternatively stop off at Barnsley House (now a luxury hotel) which has one of the best-loved gardens in England, created by renowned horticulturalist Rosemary Verey. To complete the Romantic Road head back to Little Faringdon House via the town of Painswick, known for its immaculate 99 yew trees in the churchyard.</p>

Visit the adjacent Maasai village, take a morning bush walk with an armed ranger or enjoy sundowners in the evening or even dinner under the stars in the middle of the African bush.<br /><br />In the Mara, the wildlife is abundant and the swaying grasslands ensure that animals are never out of sight. Elephants browse amongst the large herds of wildebeest, topi, gazelle, eland and buffalo. The plains offer a rich variety of food for the dominant predators: lion, leopard, hyena and cheetah. In the Mara River, hippos submerge while crocodiles sunbathe on the riverbanks.<br /><br />Around July to September, rain depending, the Masai Mara is host to the famous wildebeest migration which is one of the few remaining mass migrations of mammals in the world. During this time herds of over a million wildebeest will trawl their way through this region and they become the major focus for predatory activity and drama unfolds at every corner.<br /><br />There are also options for a morning balloon safari or a half-day visit to Lake Victoria.<br /><br />Balloon Safari: As the balloon is inflated against the first rays of sunrise your pilot will go through safety procedures. Once aloft, the balloon floats gently over the plains, giving a bird's eye view of the game below as the sun creeps slowly over the horizon. After around one hour the balloon lands as breakfast is already being prepared and, of course, enjoy a glass or two of bubbly to toast your flight in a tradition initiated by the Montgolfier brothers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lake Victoria Adventure : An early start this morning with a transfer to the airstrip for a flight by light aircraft to Lake Victoria. On arrival enjoy an appetising full English breakfast before you board the boat for the morning. There will be the opportunity to try fishing for the legendary giant Nile perch found in these waters as you explore the myriad of tiny islands in this region of the lake. An experienced and knowledgeable fisherman captains each boat.

The estate is made up of 23,000 glorious acres of Scottish wilderness at the narrowest point of the British Isles. From the highest point it is possible to see both the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea. As well as enjoying the spectacular scenery and fresh air of the Highlands, you will learn from the Ranger about the pioneering work of the estate which aims to restore much of the native forest and the wildlife, such as wild boar, which is once again starting to roam freely in it's natural habitat. Your visit to the estate will contribute directly to this conservation project.</p>
<p>
After returning to the Lodge for lunch, you will have an afternoon free to explore the landscape by mountain bike.</p>
<p>

The estate's flora and fauna is a unique experience which includes the remnants of the 'Great Wood of Caledon' which covered much of Caledonia during Roman times. Birdlife at the estate is exceptional and include golden eagle, osprey, peregrine falcon and the merlin. We recommend you bring binoculars to truly appreciate the wildlife opportunities.</p>
<p>
Other wildlife includes the notoriously shy badger, which may be observed in a their hide. It may also be possible to spot deer, elk, Highland cattle, pine martin, red fox, and otter. Red squirrels, which have become almost extinct in the British Isles are currently being reintroduced on the estate and so keep your eyes peeled. One of the estate's conservation projects includes a study on wild boar, supervised by Oxford University's Wildlife Conservation Research Unit. Your Ranger will detail these projects to you first hand.</p>
<p>
Return to the Lodge for an ample lunch and then venture out for an afternoon with your choice of either trout fly fishing (1 April  -30 September) or to observe salmon leaping (seasonal). A selection of Orvis fishing rods and tackle are available at the Lodge for use during your stay.</p>

<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>OPTIONAL CLAY BIRD SHOOTING, PONY TREKKING OR EXCURSION</h5>
<p>Today you may choose simply to relax at the Lodge or explore the eastate further.</p>
<p>
Alternatively you may like to take advantage of one of optional activities such as clay bird shooting or pony trekking through the lochs and glens of the estate. There are pony tracks throughout the estate and your guide will inform you of the points of interest along the way, such as the ruins of old crofts left as silent evidence of the infamous Highland Clearances.</p>
<p>
For those wishing to explore the Highlands further there are a range of places to visit within driving distance. On the east coast, Dornoch is a quaint historic town that is home to a small cathedral church that was the venue for the wedding of Madonna and Guy Richie. Dornoch is also home to the most northerly of Scotland's great links golf courses, the Royal Dornoch.</p>
<p>
 To the north of here lies Dunrobin Castle, home of Lord Strathnaver. Built in a fairytale French style, this castle is one of the most unusual in appearance in Scotland; it has many richly furnished rooms to explore, and overlooks an extensive park. In the opposite direction in Tain is the Glenmorangie Distillery where many people's favorite brand of malt whisky is produced; distillery tours and tastings are available on all weekdays, and weekends during the Summer.</p>
<p>
Heading west through the mountains, you are treated to some of the finest scenery that Scotland has to offer. The mountains of this region present a bleak, glacially eroded landscape where it is possible to imagine the warfare that took place between the Highland clans in bygone eras. People stopping at the striking Falls of Shin may be able to see salmon attempting their great leap over the cascade in order to get upstream. Those who continue further west into the Assynt region see some famous mountains like Suilven and Quinag before reaching the Atlantic Coast. Lochinver and Ullapool are two attractive small towns that have excellent views over the ocean and the surrounding coastal hills.
</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> The Lodge<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>HIGHLANDS - GLENEAGLES VIA LOCH NESS, BEN NEVIS AND GLENCOE</h5>
<p> Today you will see some of Scotland's best-known places on a full day journey to Gleneagles with your guide and private vehicle.  Leave Alladale and drive south to Inverness, the 'capital' of the Scottish Highlands, along the River Ness until you reach Loch Ness, home of the fabled monster. You will visit the ruins of Urquhart Castle that dominate the deepest part of the lake, and from where the monster has been seen more often than from any other place!</p>
<p>
Continue along the Great Glen past Ben Nevis, the highest mountain in Scotland, to Fort William that stands at the head of Loch Linnhe. Your route continues along Glencoe, scene of the infamous massacre of the MacDonalds by the Campbells. At the head of this valley, cross the wild and grandiose upland plain called Rannoch Moor. On reaching Crianlarich, turn east and head to Gleneagles Hotel.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Gleneagles<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 8</h4>
<h5>THE TROSSACHS &AMP; ABERFOYLE</h5>
<p>  This morning your guide will lead you on an excursion into the Trossachs, the scenic region to the west of Gleneagles that was the lair of the infamous outlaw Rob Roy McGregor. Drive through the woods and hills of the region to Loch Katrine, where you will take a scenic boat cruise on this lonely and picturesque stretch of water.</p>
<p>
Return to Gleneagles via Aberfoyle, once the home of the Scottish Wool Centre where various breeds of sheep are reared whose fleeces are used locally.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Gleneagles<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 9</h4>
<h5>GLENEAGLES AND OPTIONAL EXCURSION TO STIRLNG</h5>
<p> You may choose to spend a full day enjoying the excellent leisure facilities on the Gleneagles estate.</p>
<p>
For those seeking a more cultural experience, one possible excursion is to Stirling, where the castle is one of the most important historically in Scotland. The impressive Great Hall and the Chapel Royal dominate the plains around Stirling Bridge, where the 'Braveheart' William Wallace defeated the English army in 1297. To the south of Stirling, the Battlefield of Banockburn is where Robert the Bruce finally sent the English out from Scotland in 1314.</p>
<p>
Also near Gleneagles are the beautiful formal gardens of Drummond Castle where a guided tour with a horticulturalist can be arranged. If you think you have seen these gardens before, they were used as a main location in the film 'Rob Roy', based around the life of the notorious outlaw who lived in this area of central Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Gleneagles<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>

Highland forest covers the 610 metre (2,000 ft) sheer sides of the caldera, a spectacular barrier encircling and protecting the roaming plains wildlife which patrol the flat crater floor. This is a world of wide grassland plains, acacia copses, pools and streams. All the 'Big Five' are here - elephant, buffalo, lion, leopard and even rhino can still be found.

On arrival at the park drive to your lodge with game viewing en-route. Serengeti is the home of the great wildebeest migration and the short grass plains around your accommodation provide the perfect setting for the wildebeest as they mass around the area during the birthing of their young in the early months of each year.<br /><br />Kusini is perfectly located in a private corner of the Serengeti and sited among a cluster of kopjes (beautiful outcrops of granite rock).&nbsp; Part of Kusini's charm is its remote and private location within the park borders and with no other camps in the near vicinity Kusini offers exceptional and essentially private game viewing.<br /></p>";

A wide range of activities are offered at Olonana and you can plan your day to be as active or as leisurely as you wish. Visit the adjacent Maasai village, take a morning bush walk with an armed ranger or enjoy sundowners in the evening or even dinner under the stars in the middle of the African bush.<br /><br />In the Mara, the wildlife is abundant and the swaying grasslands ensure that animals are never out of sight. Elephants browse amongst the large herds of wildebeest, topi, gazelle, eland and buffalo. The plains offer a rich variety of food for the dominant predators: lion, leopard, hyena and cheetah. In the Mara River, hippos submerge while crocodiles sunbathe on the riverbanks.<br /><br />Around July to September, rain depending, the Masai Mara is host to the famous wildebeest migration which is one of the few remaining mass migrations of mammals in the world. During this time herds of over a million wildebeest will trawl their way through this region and they become the major focus for predatory activity and drama unfolds at every corner.<br /><br />There are also options for a morning balloon safari or a half-day visit to Lake Victoria.<br /><br />Balloon Safari: As the balloon is inflated against the first rays of sunrise your pilot will go through safety procedures. Once aloft, the balloon floats gently over the plains, giving a bird's eye view of the game below as the sun creeps slowly over the horizon. After around one hour the balloon lands as breakfast is already being prepared and, of course, enjoy a glass or two of bubbly to toast your flight in a tradition initiated by the Montgolfier brothers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lake Victoria Adventure : An early start this morning with a transfer to the airstrip for a flight by light aircraft to Lake Victoria. On arrival enjoy an appetising full English breakfast before you board the boat for the morning. There will be the opportunity to try fishing for the legendary giant Nile perch found in these waters as you explore the myriad of tiny islands in this region of the lake. An experienced and knowledgeable fisherman captains each boat. There is the chance to stop at a traditional fishing village and see how the villagers live from day to day before returning to the airstrip for your return flight to the Masai Mara.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p>";
