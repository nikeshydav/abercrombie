Your guide will bring to life the atmosphere of Rome's pulsating heart, crowded with people from across the Roman Empire. Your guide will also explain the other nearby Emperor's forums; Traiana, Augusto and Cesare.</p>

<h4>Day 9</h4>
<h5>Underground Rome</h5>
<p>Take a journey back in time during your half day (4 hours) excursion accompanied by your expert guide and driver. Explore the unique church of St. Clemente as you descend down three levels and through two thousand years of history! The medieval church was built over the remains of a 4th century basilica which, in turn, covers buildings from the time of the emperor Nero and a sanctuary dedicated to the oriental divinity, Mithras.</p>
<p>The medieval basilica houses one of the finest mosaics from the period, representing the Tree of Life. Continue to one of Rome's' most important catacombs, those of San Sebastiano. In burying their dead in underground cemeteries outside of the city walls, the early Christians were simply obeying the laws of time. They were not forced to use them because of persecution, as later popular myth has suggested. Many saints were buried here, and the catacombs later became shrines and places of pilgrimage.</p>
<p>For your final evening in Rome, come together as a family once again with dinner on your own private terrace in an exquisite villa drinking in the panoramic views of the Eternal City.</p>

Once aloft, the balloon floats gently over the plains, giving a bird's eye view of the game below as the sun creeps slowly over the horizon.

Enjoy a full day exploring the Serengeti by 4WD vehicle with thrilling morning and afternoon game drives. Whether this is your first time on safari or a return trip the Serengeti will not disappoint.<br /><br />The Serengeti National Park is arguably the most famous national park in the world. The Serengeti perhaps defines the safari experience as surely as the wildlife that inhabits it. Established in 1951, and covering an area of almost 15,000 sq km, an area comparable to the state of Connecticut or Northern Ireland, the Serengeti hosts a fantastically diverse ecosystem. The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, where 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other plains game that follow close behind, make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";

All excursions are escorted by an experienced armed guide.<br /><br />Selous Sand Rivers is situated on the banks of the Rufiji River, offering a unique combination of adventure, comfort and exclusivity. This small luxury lodge, crafted out of local materials, comprises six individually designed cottages with en-suite bathrooms. Spaced along the river bank, each has its own private view of the wide sand-banked river with its hippos, crocodiles and birdlife.

The Selous supports around one million game animals, is bigger than Switzerland and is a World Heritage site.

Transfer from Arusha to Ngorongoro Crater Lodge located on the rim with spectacular views across the crater. The Ngorongoro Crater is the largest unbroken caldera in the world and the first sight of it is breathtaking.<br /><br />Ngorongoro Crater Lodge is situated on the edge of the ancient crater rim above the cool, swirling mists. The lodge is a return to the noble elegance of the travelling colonials. Inspired in design by the Maasai Manyatta, three separate camps of 6 to 12 suites each remember a bygone era when characters such as Lord Delamere adorned the stilted, handcrafted structures with graceful antiques, grand chandeliers and treasures collected from travels through Africa.<br /><br /></p>";

Rhinos can often be seen with calves at heel. Eland and waterbuck appear not to notice the human visitors, enabling photographers to shoot at ease. On the lake in the middle of the crater you may see thousands of flamingos fluttering and shimmering like a pink heat haze. Zebra and wildebeest account for almost half the animals.
