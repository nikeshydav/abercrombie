The museum at the site shows how this area played an important part in understanding early human evolution.<br /><br />After your visit drive to the Serengeti, one of the most magnificent parks in Africa. On arrival drive to Kusini which is perfectly sited in a cluster of kopjes (beautiful outcrops of granite rock). Part of Kusini's charm is its remote and private location within the park borders and with no other camps in the near vicinity Kusini offers exceptional and essentially private game viewing.&nbsp;<br /><br />Serengeti is the home of the great Wildebeest migration and the short grass plains around Kusini provide the perfect setting for the wildebeest as they mass around the area during the birthing of their young in the early months of each year.&nbsp;<br /></p>";

<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 13 Nights</p>
<p>The beautiful landscapes of southwest China lend themselves perfectly to a driving journey to places otherwise near impossible to reach.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>Arrive Chengdu</h5>
<p>Arrive in Chengdu today and settle in to your hotel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Chengdu</h5>
<p>All the documents will be prepared for your temporary Chinese driving license; you will just need to complete the formalities and the day is yours to have a taste of Chengdu - visiting the giant panda research base or quite literally with a cooking lesson in a riverside restaurant.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>Chengdu/Ya'an</h5>
<p>Begin your driving journey as you depart Chengdu for Ya'an, the start of the famous Tea and Horse Caravan Road. You won't miss the Leshan Buddha en route; the world's largest stone Buddha standing 70 metres tall at the confluence of two rivers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>Ya'an/Ma'erkang</h5>
<p>Today's drive will take you north over your first 4,000 metre mountain pass and through beautiful valleys towards the town of Ma'erkang surrounded by apple and walnut orchards. This region is an ethnically Tibetan region; the most obvious sign of which is the prayer flags flapping in the breeze.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>Ma'erkang/Ganzi</h5>
<p>As you drive west along the G317 deeper into the wild countryside of the Ganzi region, pass through the area around Luhuo that was once home to gangs of bandit. The road winds through forested valleys before cresting a 4,000 metre pass and dropping down into the stunning Yalong River valley towards Ganzi.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>Ganzi</h5>
<p>Today is yours to relax, acclimatise to the high altitude and prepare for more strenuous driving days ahead. You may like to visit a secluded Buddhist nunnery or observe daily life from a local teahouse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>Ganzi/Mount Chola Pass/Dege</h5>
<p>The drive to Dege is a real experience - a slow drive along the Yalong River valley to the wild frontier town of Ma'nigange, stopping by the side of Lake Yilhun-La Tso for a picnic, before tackling the climb across the magnificent Mount Chola Pass. Dege is the edge of the 'Roof of the World' where the Bakong Scripture Printing Monastery built during the Qing Dynasty still produces over 2,500 handmade religious tracts each day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 8</h4>
<h5>Deg/Chamdo, Tibet</h5>
<p>Cross the border from Sichuan into Tibet through valleys dotted with farms and herds of yaks. Between Jomda and Chamdo the countryside changes dramatically to high plateau and the road snakes around smooth green hillsides to the old capital Chamdo, home to the Galden Champaling monastery that is one of the largest in the region.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 9</h4>
<h5> Chamdo/Rawok</h5>
<p>Join China's longest national road (G318) winding from Shanghai all the way to the Mount Everest Base Camp. This road will take you up the Mount Yela Pass on a well-paved road and down through 72 turns on one of the most exciting descents. Rawok lies on the shores of Lake Rawok, perfect for watching the sun set over the nearby glaciers that feed the lake.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 10</h4>
<h5> Rawok/Pomi</h5>
<p>Driving through the Sundzom Valley towards Pomi, turn off the main road to explore the valleys around Midui Glacier, perhaps hiking or taking a ride on horseback before a picnic lunch.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 11</h4>
<h5> Pomi/Bayi</h5>
<p>Experience the extremes of the G318, leaving smooth pavement behind as the road narrows and winds along a steep hillside. You will need to take this short section of road slowly before the road improves dramatically and turns towards the Serkym-La Pass where on a clear day you will be rewarded with a view of eastern Tibet's highest mountain, Mount Namjagbarwa.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 12</h4>
<h5>Bayi/Lhasa</h5>
<p>The highest pass of the trip, the 5,025 metre Pa-La Pass lies before you and the valley gradually opens up to the Tibetan capital Lhasa. Why not celebrate having completed your drive with a Tibetan meal and evening dance performance?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 13</h4>
<h5>Lhasa</h5>
<p>Lhasa's old city is a warren of prayer-wheel workshops, pool halls and teahouses among the scores of pilgrims waiting to worship at the holiest shrine of Tibetan Buddhism - the golden-roofed Jokhang. Lhasa is a wonderful place to sit and watch the world go by, and however you spend it, today is sure to be a fitting end to your amazing journey.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 14</h4>
<h5>Depart Lhasa</h5>
<p>Return to Chengdu by plane while the cars are driven back. You may like to extend your journey in Lhasa or Chengdu or travel to the Mount Everest Base Camp.</p>
</li>

Elephants browse amongst the large herds of wildebeest and topi, gazelle, eland and buffalo. The plains offer a rich variety of food for the dominant predators: lion, leopard, hyena and cheetah. In the Mara River, hippos submerge to snort and grumble while crocodiles sunbathe on the riverbanks. Around July to September, rain depending, the Masai Mara is host to the famous wildebeest migration which is one of the few remaining mass migrations of mammals in the world. During this time herds of over a million wildebeest will trawl their way through this region and they become the major focus for predatory activity and drama unfolds at every corner.<br /><br />There are also options for a morning balloon safari or a half-day visit to Lake Victoria.<br /><br />Balloon Safari: As the balloon is inflated against the first rays of sunrise your pilot will go through safety procedures. Once aloft, the balloon floats gently over the plains, giving a bird's eye view of the game below as the sun creeps slowly over the horizon. After around one hour the balloon lands and nearby breakfast is already being prepared and, of course, glasses of bubbly to toast your flight in a tradition initiated by the Montgolfier brothers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lake Victoria Adventure: An early start this morning with a transfer to take you to the airstrip for a flight by light aircraft to Lake Victoria. On arrival enjoy an appetising full English breakfast before you board the boat for the morning. There will be the opportunity to try fishing for the legendary giant Nile perch found in these waters as you explore the myriad of tiny islands in this region of the lake. An experienced and knowledgeable fisherman captains each boat.
