<h5>SERIFOS &AMP; KYTHNOS</h5>

Moreover, apart from Livadi and the Monastery of the Taxiarchs in the north, there is much to be seen. Its highest point is Mount Tourlos with 483 m. The island's main sources of income are its modest agriculture and its open-cast iron mines, which have been worked since ancient times.</p>
<p>
Kythnos is an unspoiled island.  The coast is much indented - with many beautiful anchorages and ports - and for the most part falls steeply down to the sea. The two charming inland villages, Chora (Kythnos town) and the lively little Dryopis, can best be visited by scooter or bike. The two main ports are Mericha and Loutra. Mericha - only minutes sailing away from the oddly shaped Sandbar Bay - is the smaller of the two. Loutra on the north-east nowadays even has a new harbour with new moles providing the best protection from the Meltemi on the island.</p>

A wide range of activities are offered at Olonana and you can plan your day to be as active or as leisurely as you wish. Visit the adjacent Maasai village, take a morning bush walk with an armed ranger or enjoy sundowners in the evening or even dinner under the stars in the middle of the African bush.<br /><br />In the Mara, the wildlife is abundant and the swaying grasslands ensure that animals are never out of sight. Elephants browse amongst the large herds of wildebeest, topi, gazelle, eland and buffalo. The plains offer a rich variety of food for the dominant predators: lion, leopard, hyena and cheetah. In the Mara River, hippos submerge while crocodiles sunbathe on the riverbanks.<br /><br />Around July to September, rain depending, the Masai Mara is host to the famous wildebeest migration which is one of the few remaining mass migrations of mammals in the world. During this time herds of over a million wildebeest will trawl their way through this region and they become the major focus for predatory activity and drama unfolds at every corner.<br /><br />There are also options for a morning balloon safari or a half-day visit to Lake Victoria.<br /><br />Balloon Safari: As the balloon is inflated against the first rays of sunrise your pilot will go through safety procedures. Once aloft, the balloon floats gently over the plains, giving a bird's eye view of the game below as the sun creeps slowly over the horizon. After around one hour the balloon lands as breakfast is already being prepared and, of course, enjoy a glass or two of bubbly to toast your flight in a tradition initiated by the Montgolfier brothers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lake Victoria Adventure : An early start this morning with a transfer to the airstrip for a flight by light aircraft to Lake Victoria. On arrival enjoy an appetising full English breakfast before you board the boat for the morning. There will be the opportunity to try fishing for the legendary giant Nile perch found in these waters as you explore the myriad of tiny islands in this region of the lake. An experienced and knowledgeable fisherman captains each boat. There is the chance to stop at a traditional fishing village and see how the villagers live from day to day before returning to the airstrip for your return flight to the Masai Mara.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p>";

The Serengeti perhaps defines the safari experience as surely as the wildlife that inhabits it. Established in 1951, and covering an area of almost 15,000 sq km, an area comparable to the state of Connecticut or Northern Ireland, the Serengeti hosts a fantastically diverse ecosystem. The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, where 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other plains game that follow close behind, make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";

The Selous supports around one million game animals, is bigger than Switzerland and is a World Heritage site.

Transfer from Arusha to Ngorongoro Crater Lodge located on the rim with spectacular views across the crater. The Ngorongoro Crater is the largest unbroken caldera in the world and the first sight of it is breathtaking.<br /><br />Ngorongoro Crater Lodge is situated on the edge of the ancient crater rim above the cool, swirling mists. The lodge is a return to the noble elegance of the travelling colonials. Inspired in design by the Maasai Manyatta, three separate camps of 6 to 12 suites each remember a bygone era when characters such as Lord Delamere adorned the stilted, handcrafted structures with graceful antiques, grand chandeliers and treasures collected from travels through Africa.<br /><br /></p>";

Rhinos can often be seen with calves at heel. Eland and waterbuck appear not to notice the human visitors, enabling photographers to shoot at ease.
