<dt><h2>Nairobi</h2> 
<p>Most tours of Kenya start from its capital city Nairobi. Some of the famous Nairobi tours include major attractions like the Nairobi National Park that is strategically located at a distance of 10 kilometres from the centre and the Karen Blixen Museum which was made famous by the movie 'Out of Africa'. </p>
<div class="thepet"><p>To take care of the animals there is the Giraffe Centre- sanctuary for the endangered Rothschild giraffe and Daphne Sheldrick's animal orphanage for wild animals which rears and reintroduces them to their natural habitat (mainly rhino and elephant). You can also have a stroll in the open air Maasai markets.</p>

<dt><h2>Amboseli National Park</h2> 
<p>Surrounded by snow-capped mountains of Africa's highest mountain, Mount Kilimanjaro; the wildlife reserve of Amboseli lies south of Nairobi. An excellent sight for game-viewing, the reserve is home to lions, cheetah, rhino, buffalo, elephant etc. Amboseli National Park is bordered with Tanzania which runs along its base providing a mixed typography. </p>
<div class="thepet"><p>The park has five main wildlife habitats- open plains, acacia woodland, rocky thorn bush area, swamps and marshland and a seasonal lake Amboseli. This temporary lake floods when it rains heavily in the area giving form to a habitat that attracts wide varieties of birds. There is a chain of hills by the name of Chyulu which are of volcanic nature within close distance of the park. It gives sports like hiking and horse riding safaris a chance to flourish. </p>

<dt><h2>Tsavo East and West National Parks</h2> 
<p>Tsavo East and West National Parks when combined together cover an area of 21,812 square kilometres making it the world's largest game sanctuaries. Once famous for its rhino and elephants, Tsavo East is a harsh arid desert that makes it a unique Kenya tourist place.</p>
<div class="thepet"><p>Though travellers would have a rough time game viewing in such harsh conditions but that makes it even more challenging. On the other hand, Tsavo West is more about forests and arid desert plains contrasted against riverine groves and lava flows of Shetani. In the enclosure of the rhino sanctuary you can spot the endangered black rhino. At no point of the day can anything take away attention from the Mzima Springs which are pristine clear water spring forming an oasis with raffia palms and fig trees. If you go underwater you may even be welcomed by large crocodiles and pods of hippo. </p>

<dt><h2>
THE LAIKIPIA REGION, LEWA CONSERVANCY & MOUNT KENYA</h2> 
<p>The Laikipia region is a vast land of game-rich grasslands that are surrounded by hills that stretch from one end in the north to the other in the south. Where there are snow-capped mountains of Mount Kenya on one side, there is the wilderness of deserts on the other. Huge areas of land have been converted to private game reserves and helping them in their cause are the local communities which have joined the ranches to protect their safe haven. </p>
<div class="thepet"><p> <br />One of East Africa's great successes is Lewa conservancy which has dedicated itself to conservation having saved over sixty rhinoceros both black and white. With exceptional game views in the region, custom built safari on foot and camel or horseback has become very famous with travellers. For an in-depth travel experience, they provide exquisite cultural visits to various community development projects including scenic flights, private luxury mobile camps, fly camping or camping in the night. Kenya's another great success is the Ol Pejeta Conservancy with its chimp sanctuary. Try the famous Mt. Kenya Safari club and the isolated volcanic range Aberdares, eastern wall of the Rift Valley. It is lined with alpine landscapes with vast cedar forests, heather moorlands and bamboo groves growing out in abundance. These are pumped with icy streams and waterfalls in between to give the whole scene a dreamy experience. Home to rarest Kenya antelope and bongo, the region is a must on the itinerary. </p>

<dt><h2>Lake Turkana</h2> 
<p>For those who like treading in areas that are not travelled by the general masses, this is one such place. Home to nomadic tribes and archaeological sites, UNESCO World Heritage has categorised the area of Lake Turkana National park as a gem.</p>
<div class="thepet"><p> Fly here in a private charter to witness a wildlife wonder where migratory birds come and mate and Nile crocodiles and hippopotamus breed. A known Heritage site, it has fossil remains. On the eastern shore is Sibiloi where remains of the Australopithecus were found. This place is the world's largest permanent desert lake, the world's largest alkaline lake and the world's fourth largest salt lake. </p>

<dt><h2>Samburu, Buffalo Springs & Shaba National Reserves</h2> 
<p>Ol Olokwe at one side and Uaso Nyiro River on the other, this vast land of wilderness has a lot on its offer. Featured as a must Kenya tourist place, Samburu, Buffalo Springs and Shaba National Reserves lie in northern Kenya and are situated adjacent to each other. </p>
<div class="thepet"><p>Depending on the waters of Uaso Nyiro River for its existence, this semi-arid zone offers a great wildlife surprise along the lines of the water base. Attracting a wide variety of animals and birds not found in Southern parts of the equator, your eyes get a treat here. Beisa oryx, the reticulated giraffe, the thin-striped Grevy's zebra and the gerenuk antelope which stands on its hind legs to feed are all there. There are other animals too like the elephant, buffalo, lion and leopard with almost a 400 plus species of birds that can be spotted if you are a patient bird-watcher. 
<br />Cousins of the Maasai, Samburu tribe have their homes in the Reserves. They work in tandem with the private sanctuaries in the area to protect the nomadic and tribal life of this tribe while keeping a close tab on the local wildlife.</p>

<p>Unexplored, less visited is how you would describe Meru National Park which has preserved its natural beauty because of less interference from mankind. Its ecological set up is a little different with swamps, savannah and forests all at one place. </p>
<div class="thepet"><p>There are endless streams which come out of Tana River, giving life to the area. Thick forest cover, tall grass and Doum palms make the park a must visit for all nature lovers. It is home to the world famous lioness Elsa, of Born Free fame which was returned to the wild here.</p></div>

<p>A trip to the valley of Great Rift will always remain etched in your memory with views of Mount Longonot and Lake Naivasha, a freshwater lake that waters thick papyrus on the way. Surrounded by beauty, it is next to the Hell's Gate National Park which gets its name from the gigantic red cliffs that give form to natural bubbling springs and steam vents because of active geothermal forces.</p>
<div class="thepet"><p>As you go down there is Lake Elementaita, a small soda lake in the east of the Rift. Also home to Lake Nakaru; the valley offers a peek into pink flamingos, rhino and leopards. You can also see Lake Bogoria which offers great spellbinding views of volcanic ranges. Lakes and thick green cover invites various birds and wildlife to the Valley. Its Lake Baringo that attracts a huge flock of flamingos while on the other hand the Valley boasts of bubbling geothermal pools, fresh water springs, sprouting geysers and more.</p>

<dt><h2>Masai Mara National Reserve</h2> 
<p>Known worldwide for its rich and exotic locale, Masai Mara lies in the northern part of the Mara-Serengeti ecosystem. Mara witnesses wildebeest migration from July-September when the entire area sees the beautiful animal running across the field in huge numbers. The timings could however change according to the climate. As this is an act taking place only in East Africa, over two million animals migrate in a year-round pattern carrying out their journey in greener pastures including Tanzania and Kenya. This is the time when you get to witness the Big Five active.</p>
<div class="thepet"><p> A mesmerising sight to watch, predators act during this time of the year to grab their share. In October, main herds move towards Tanzania.Also home to a cultural vibrancy, Mara offers a sincere peek into traditional and ancient customs. Get to know more about Masai Mara by driving deep into one of the Maasai villages. A day trip or an overnight one from Mara can also take you to the world's second largest freshwater lake, Lake Victoria where you can indulge in activities like Nile perch fishing, exciting water sports and also visit the Luo tribe for an authentic feel into the Mara culture

<dt><h2>Coastal Kenya</h2> 
<p>The coastal area of Kenya is a tropical paradise with white sandy beaches adorned with Palm trees, waters of the Indian Ocean and beautiful coral reefs. At the coast is the cosmopolitan town of Mombasa, Kenya's second largest town which has a rich mixture of Asian, Arabic and African cultures. For deep sea fishing, towns of Malindi and Watamu are ideal. </p>
<div class="thepet"><p>Coastal Kenya also boasts of a rich legacy from the 16th century with Fort Jesus, old town and Dhow harbour sitting pretty in the vicinity. Famous for the coral reefs, Kenya has a wide cover of protective reefs that make the waters of the ocean calm and serene. They also invite travellers for world-class diving experience in the coral gardens. It also promotes water sports like skiing, windsurfing and deep sea-fishing possible. Along the coastline is Lamu, an ancient Arab island lost with its long history of mosques and narrow streets. You can explore other smaller islands too. </p>
