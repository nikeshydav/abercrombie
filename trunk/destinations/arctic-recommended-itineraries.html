   <h5>Detailed Itinerary</h5>
<li>
    
     <h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>Arrive Montreal</h5>
<p>Arrive in Montreal, Quebec’s European-style city. Transfer to your hotel before meeting your local guide for an afternoon walking tour. Tonight, gather with your A&K Expedition Team for a welcome cocktail reception and dinner to celebrate the start of your adventure.<br /><br />

<strong>Overnight:	Fairmont Queen Elizabeth<br />
Meals:		D</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Kangerlussuaq | Edge of Indlandsis</h5>
<p>Arrive by charter flight this afternoon in Western Greenland at Kangerlussuaq (Søndre Strømfjord in Danish), located on the tip of its namesake fjord and once a strategic allied stronghold during World War II. Weather and time permitting, visit the edge of the Greenland ice sheet (indlandsis), a vast body of inland ice covering 80 percent of the continent. En route, be on the lookout for native wildlife, such as musk ox, reindeer, Arctic foxes, falcons and eagles. Later, arrive at the pier to board your luxurious expedition cruiser, ‘Le Boreal.’ Tonight, join your award-winning Expedition Team and crew for a welcome cocktail reception.<br /><br />


<strong>Overnight:	Le Boreal<br />
Meals:		B L D</strong>

</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Days 3-8</h4>
<h5>Western Greenland | Where Amundsen Began</h5>
<p>In 1906, polar explorer Roald Amundsen became the first person to successfully cross the entire Northwest Passage. Start your voyage exactly where Amundsen did — along the stunning West Coast of Greenland and north into Baffin Bay, which you explore for six days. Your enrichment and lecture program also begins, offering the first of many opportunities to delve deeper into the story of this dramatic and remote region.<br /><br />
    <p>Based on ice, weather and sea conditions, your captain and expedition crew determine the day’s best sightseeing opportunities, which may include:</p>
<strong> Sisimiut:  </strong>Located just north of the Arctic Circle, Sisimiut is both the northernmost city in Greenland able to maintain a year-round, ice-free port as well as the southernmost town with sufficient snow for dog sledding through the winter and spring. Visit the local museum with its interactive exhibits on Inuit culture and Greenlandic colonial history, as well as a local dog musher and his dog-sled team.<br /><br />

<strong>Disko Bay & Ilulissat:   </strong>: Cruise into Disko Bay, a wide inlet off the Baffin Sea first explored by Erik the Red in AD 985, when he established the first Norse settlements in Western Greenland. Discover the Ilulissat Icefjord, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, at the sea mouth of one of the fastest and most active glaciers in the world, Sermeq Kujalleq. The scene is spectacular with giant icebergs, floating growlers and bergy bits (large chunks of glacial ice), and the sounds of the calving ice-stream. Take a walking tour of the village of Ilulissat, including a visit to the local history museum, and meet with villagers in their multicolored homes to learn about life in this often-harsh Arctic region. Enjoy a huskie dog-sled demonstration and learn about the centuries-old methods of leather tanning still in practice today.<br /><br />

<strong>Kullorsuaq:    </strong> : Located at the southern end of Melville Bay, Kullorsuaq is the northernmost village in the Upernavik Archipelago, and one of the northernmost settlements in Western Greenland. Founded in 1928 as a trading station, Kullorsuaq received its first migrants some 4,000 years ago as well as the migration of all southbound Inuits that followed. It stands today as one of the most traditional hunting and fishing villages in Greenland. Grasp the full meaning when you spend time with local villagers who still maintain a traditional way of life, living off of the narwhal and seal populations common to the region.<br /><br />

<strong>Melville Bay: </strong>Enjoy excursions on Zodiacs (sturdy inflatable boats) through this remote area of far Northwestern Greenland, and among thousands of small icebergs and bergy bits.<br /><br />


<strong>Overnight:	Le Boreal<br />
Meals:		B L D</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Days 9-15</h4>
<h5>Nunavut & the Canadian Arctic Archipelago | The Heart of the Northwest Passage</h5>
<p>Cruise west across Baffin Bay and into the Canadian Arctic Archipelago of Nunavut, where you begin your journey to the heart — and history — of the Northwest Passage. The A&K Expedition Team continues to share a captivating lecture program to enhance your own discovery<br /><br />
 <p>As ‘Le Boreal’ winds it way through legendary channels and inlets, your crew and Expedition Team will determine the best route based on ice, weather and sea conditions. Exciting excursions await and are likely to include:</p>
<strong> Pond Inlet:   </strong>: Located on the Northern end of Baffin Island, Pond Inlet is the noted gateway to the fabled Northwest Passage. After clearing customs formalities for Nunavut, set off for a shore excursion to an area originally inhabited by the Thule (ancestors of the Inuit). Visit the Nattinnak Visitor’s Center or Toonoonik Sahoonik Co-op, where you can shop for artisan carvings made from local red and green soapstone, beautiful wall hangings and other handcrafted goods.<br /><br />

<strong>Lancaster Sound:    </strong>Situated between Devon Island and Baffin Island, this body of water forms the eastern entrance to the Parry Channel and the Northwest Passage. It’s also home to a rich abundance of Arctic cod, which in turn draws copious populations of sea birds and marine mammals. Beluga and endangered bowhead whales, the narwhal with its spiraling tusk, ringed and bearded seals, the enchanting polar bear, and mustached walrus, as well as northern fulmars, black guillemots and Arctic terns — all are among the fantastic wildlife that inhabit the area. And, some may come into view on exciting Zodiac excursions and landings.

<br /><br />

<strong> Beechey Island:   </strong> : Historic moments in Arctic exploration define this island, best known for providing a safe haven to British explorer Sir John Franklin in 1845. Look east toward Resolute Bay at the huge silhouette of Cape Riley and imagine what Captain Franklin saw here in Erebus Harbour, were he took shelter for two years before his ill-fated attempt to conquer the Northwest Passage. See the wooden grave markers for three of Franklin’s men, now bleached by the sun, and visit the cenotaph memorial erected in memory of the lost explorer. It is an unforgettable experience.<br /><br />

<strong>Gjoa Haven:  </strong>: During his first attempt to transit the Northwest Passage on ‘Gjøa,’ Roald Amundsen used this natural harbor as a respite while waiting for ice conditions to improve. For two years, he lived with the Netsilik Inuits, learning their skills for survival and more efficient travel, which would later prove invaluable in his successful South Pole expedition. Today, Gjoa Haven has a population of 1,200 and still bears the historic significance of playing a key role in polar exploration.<br /><br />
<strong>Victoria Island:  </strong>: Cruise along the south coast of Victoria Island through Queen Maud Gulf, Dease Strait and Coronation Gulf. Expedition stops may include: bird sanctuary Jenny Lind Island, where you may also spy its populations of musk ox; the village of Cambridge Bay; and remote Edinburgh Island.<br /><br />

<strong>Overnight:	Le Boreal <br />
Meals:		B L D </strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 16</h4>
<h5>Franklin Bay & the Smoking Hills | Endless Fire</h5>
<p>In the Northwest Territories at Franklin Bay, see the spectacular “Smoking Hills,” cliffs of bituminous shale that combust and endlessly burn. This rare geological phenomenon has likely been occurring for millennia, with layers of the relatively unstable mineral jarosite covering these hills. When the mineral comes into contact with cold air, it becomes red-hot and produces a thick, black smoke — a fantastic site not unlike the smoky fumaroles produced by volcanoes.<br /><br />

<strong>Overnight:	Le Boreal<br />
Meals:		B L D </strong>

</p>
</li>

<li>
<h4>Day 17</h4>
<h5>Hershel Island & the Yukon Territory | A Haven in the Farthest Reaches</h5>
<p>During a long mapping expedition in 1826, Captain Franklin was the first European to lay eyes on this unique island at the northernmost point of the Yukon Territory. Named by Franklin, Herschel Island is a landmark in the West Arctic and has since served alternately as a whaling station, relay station and refuge for travellers. The island teems with wildlife that includes the migrating bowhead whale, walrus, moose, musk ox, Arctic fox and 94 species of birds. It is also one of the only places on earth where you may see a grizzly bear, black bear and polar bear, the last of which live along the ice edge in summer. Evidence of the island’s whaling culture and Thule Inuit predecessors remains near the shoreline, though it may not be for much longer; the island is subject to extreme coastal erosion and scientists predict the shoreline will disappear under the waves within 50 years.<br /><br />

</li>
<li>
<h4>Days 18-19</h4>
<h5>Beaufort Sea & Point Barrow | Sea of the White One</h5>

<p>Typically dense with ice floes and fog, the Beaufort Sea opens up a 60-mile-wide coastal pass from August to September. Continue sailing in the comfort of your luxury expedition cruiser, participating in eye-opening lectures led by the Expedition Team. Be on the lookout across the sea for bowhead and beluga whales, the latter of which sustain one of the largest populations in the world here. Still hunted on a sustenance quota basis by local Inuits, the sociable creatures often travel in numbers and are said to be quite “chatty,” with their trills, clicks and squeals audible above the surface. ‘Le Boreal’ cruises into the U.S. and clears at Point Barrow, Alaska. Your voyage continues through this narrow passage between North America and the ever-changing Arctic ice cap.<br /><br />

<h5>Little Diomede | Along the Alaskan Coast</h5>
<p>Continue cruising through the Bering Sea to Little Diomede, an island that sits between Alaska and Russia at the edge of the International Date Line. Disembark for a Zodiac cruise of the island, where the Ingalikmiut people still maintain a traditional lifestyle of hunting, fishing and egg gathering. In line with customs and necessity, the Ingalikmiut also use seal, walrus and polar bear hides to make clothing, parkas, hats and mukluks, as well as trade currency for bartering.<br /><br />

<h5>Bering Sea | Crossing the International Date Line</h5>
<p>Just south of the Arctic Circle, the Bering Strait guards the entrance to the Bering Sea, which ‘Le Boreal’ enters and where a prolific ecosystem supports an incredible, world-renowned fishery. This is the capital of Alaskan king crab. From the ship’s upper decks or your own private balcony, you may spot any number of breeding seabirds and whales (bowhead, blue, fin, sei, orca and even the rare North Pacific right), all here for the feast. The day brings a new series of enriching lectures to supplement the vast ocean views.

    <h5>Detailed Itinerary</h5>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>ARRIVE OSLO</h5>
<p>Arrive in Oslo, Norway’s modern capital city that also coexists in close harmony with nature. Transfer to your hotel before meeting your local guide for an afternoon walking tour. Tonight, gather for a private welcome reception in your hotel’s Speilen room, site of the Nobel Prize banquet.</p>
 <p> <strong>Overnight:</strong>Grand Hotel Oslo<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> L
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>LONGYEARBYEN | Long Year Town</h5>
<p>Board a charter flight to Longyearbyen, the capital of Svalbard, also known as Spitsbergen, the sovereign Arctic archipelago of Norway. It is one of the most remote group of islands on the planet, with nearly two-thirds of its surface covered in glaciers. Tour the tiny town and its Arctic museum. Following lunch, board your expedition cruiser.</p>

<p> <strong>Overnight:</strong> Le Boreal <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B L D
</p>

</li>
<li>
<h4>Days 3-6</h4>
<h5>Svalbard Islands | Spectacular Archipelago</h5>
<p>Very few people have the opportunity to view the remote wilderness of the Svalbard Islands. In the Svalbard archipelago, polar bears, walrus, Svalbard reindeer and an incredibly rich variety of birds are as abundant as are cathedrals of ice, glaciers and craggy mountain peaks. An amazing amount of diminutive flora surrounds this barren landscape, which comes alive with color under the August midnight sun. Svalbard’s wildlife is contrasted by the unexpected culture of its fishing villages. Your captain and expedition crew determine the day’s best sightseeing opportunities, which may include these extraordinary regions:</p>

<strong> Magdalenefjoren: </strong> : A stunning fjord with rugged rock walls, Magdalenefjoren surmounts blue-hued glaciers crisscrossed by crevasses, with birds perched in the high cliffs. This “glacier coast” provides magnificent views of slow-moving glaciers travelling out to sea as well as beaches frequented by walrus.<br /><br />

<strong> Ny Alesund:  </strong>History here stretches back to the early Arctic explorers. Today, a polar research station occupies the site where a Norwegian coal mine once operated, and scientists study meteorology, seismology, atmospheric sciences and marine biology. Conditions permitting, you visit the small community, including a museum, art gallery and the northernmost post office in the world.<br /><br />

<strong>Alkjefellet (Auk Mountains):   </strong> Set off on Zodiacs (sturdy inflatable boats) to explore the 325-foot sheer cliffs that are home to 60,000 guillemots and kittiwakes. These nests attract “poaching” polar bears and Arctic fox, who come for the feast of eggs and birds, and provide opportunities for us to view them safely from our Zodiacs.<br /><br />

<strong> Monaco Bay and Glacier:</strong> : Located in Northwest Spitsbergen, Monaco Bay is frequented by a variety of wildlife populations, including polar bears, walrus, harbor and bearded seals, and a multitude of seabirds.<br /><br />

<strong>Liefdefjorden </strong> (Loves Bay): In far Northern Svalbard, this is an excellent area for spotting polar bears and other Arctic wildlife.<br /><br />

Throughout our landings and days of cruising in Spitsbergen, our primary objective will be to search for polar bears as they hunt in their true natural habitat — be it on land or among the ice floes. Each landing is under the close supervision of our bear guardians, who have the best knowledge about where to find the white giants.<br /><br />

<p> <strong>Overnight:</strong> Le Boreal <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B L D
</p>

 </li>

<h4>Days 7-8</h4>
<h5>Cruising the Greenland Sea | Along the Ice Edge</h5>
<p>Cruise along the Arctic ice edge through the Greenland Sea, as lecturers recap their presentations on the wildlife, history and geology of Svalbard, and prepare you for the world’s largest island: Greenland. Spend time on board with new friends and the Expedition Team, ever on the lookout for wildlife.</p>

<p> <strong>Overnight:</strong> Le Boreal <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B L D
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Days 9-11</h4>
<h5>Greenland | Franz Josef Fjords & Scoresby Sound</h5>
<p>For the next three days, explore the rarely visited east coast of Greenland, Kejser Franz Josef Fjords and Scoresby Sound. Embark on twice-daily Zodiac excursions to cruise the intricate fjord network and search for musk ox and reindeer, which are common here. Ice conditions permitting, disembark for a visit in Ittoqqortoormiit, a small settlement founded in 1925 and one of the most isolated villages in Greenland. You may also visit the “warming island” of Uunartoq, which was once believed to be a point on the mainland of Greenland, and today provides further evidence of climate change.</p>

<p> <strong>Overnight:</strong> Le Boreal <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B L D
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 12</h4>
<h5>Cruising the Denmark Strait | Confluence of Waters</h5>
<p>Enjoy a relaxing day at sea cruising the relatively narrow strip of water that separates Greenland from Iceland, and connects the Arctic Sea with the Atlantic Ocean. Watch for seabirds and whales from the deck in between fascinating lectures presented by A&K’s Expedition Team. This evening, gather for a gala dinner hosted by the captain.

<h4>Day 13</h4>
<h5>Husavik | Whale-Watching Haven</h5>
<p>Arrive early in Husavik, the first permanent village settled in Iceland.</p>
<p>Visit the excellent Husavik Whale Museum, actively supported by A&K Philanthropy, and one of the world’s foremost centers focused on whales and their habitat. Afterward, choose to embark on a scenic whale watching tour followed by free time in Husavik.

<li>
<h4>Day 14</h4>
<h5>Grundarfjördur | Journey to the Center of the Earth</h5>
<p>Take in the glacier-carved terrain of Iceland’s West Fjords, highlighted by the sparkling waterfalls and icebergs of Drangajokull Glacier. Visit Grundarfjördur, one of the first villages in Iceland. Then, choose from three excursions. You may visit the Snaefellsnes Peninsula with its fishing villages, stunning Snaaefelsnes Glacier and views of the majestic, extinct Snaaefelsjokull volcano — the site that inspired Jules Verne’s fictional Journey to the Center of the Earth. You may also embark on a boat tour among the numerous islands of Breidafjörður, an archipelago teeming with exotic birds, followed by a catch of a fresh shellfish brought on board to enjoy straight from the sea. Or, you may hike well-known sites from the Icelandic Sagas, including the beautiful Berserkjahraun lava field; the 240-foot Mt. Helgafell (“The Holy Mountain”), with spectacular views over the Breidafjordur islands (weather permitting); and, the old town of Stykkisholmur and Bjarnarhofn (“Bear Harbor”), where you explore a shark museum and wooden Dutch church.</p>

For those who want some time out of their vehicles, the lodge supports a number of nature trails and also has a resident naturalist to enhance the experience. Guests may also choose to relax at an observation post or by the pool.<br /></p>";

From your lodge on the crater rim descend to the crater floor by 4WD safari vehicle for a morning unlike any other you will experience in Africa. Spot some of the rarer species in Africa like the black rhino against the spectacular backdrop of the crater's forest covered walls. Enjoy a picnic lunch amongst the hippos and birds before visiting a Maasai village this afternoon.<br /><br />The floor of the crater is only 100 square miles but is home to around 30,000 animals with a high concentration of predators and some of the finest black-maned lions in Africa. Rhinos can be seen with calves at heel. Eland and waterbuck appear not to notice the human visitors, enabling photographers to shoot at ease. On the lake in the middle of the crater you may see thousands of flamingos, fluttering and shimmering like a pink heat haze. Zebra and wildebeest account for almost half the animals - gazelle, buffalo, eland, hartebeest and wart hog can also be seen.<br /></p>";

Enjoy game viewing en route.<br /><br />Serengeti Serena Lodge is located high on a hill offering magnificent views of the Serengeti Plains. The lodge is pure Africa. Rustic and natural, circular like an African village, its 66 rooms make up a series of rondavels. The simple style is enhanced with sophisticated detail in the form of traditional handicraft, such as wood carvings, beadwork and pottery designs. The lodge offers its own unique game trails devised in conjunction with park consultants to allow enjoyment of the Serengeti's unequalled variety of game.<br /></p>";

Whether this is your first time on safari or a return trip, the Serengeti will not disappoint.<br /><br />The Serengeti National Park is arguably the most famous national park in the world. The Serengeti perhaps defines the safari experience as surely as the wildlife that inhabits it. Established in 1951, and covering an area of almost 15,000 square kilometers, an area comparable to the state of Connecticut or Northern Ireland, the Serengeti hosts a fantastically diverse ecosystem. The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, when 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other game that follow close behind make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";
