<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong>  5 day/4 night </p>
<li>
<p>This magical adventure is designed around co-existing with the awe-inspiring grizzly bear. This 5 day/4 night trip sees you flying into the absolute wilderness on a private viewing experience bringing you face to face with one of North America's most beautiful creatures. This trip is completely private, designed around you. We allow just four/five guests, guaranteeing an absolute intimate experience with the bears.</p>
<p>Guests begin their experience by flying into Whitehorse, the capital of Yukon. You may wish to spend a day or two here exploring Miles Canyon, Grey Mountain and the amazing salmon fish ladders which will be in full swing at this time of year. It's a two hour beautiful drive from Whitehorse to the small community of Atlin - population 450. The surrounding area is home to Taku River Tlingit First Nation.</p>
<p>At Atlin you will already feel a sense of the surrounding wilderness, but it's from here you will board a chartered helicopter leaving behind this small town and head into complete isolation. Here there are no roads within four million acres of undisturbed land.</p>
<p>Your guide and host will be Phil Timpany, a world renowned expert on Grizzly Bear behaviour. Phil has 38 years of experience in the world of the grizzly bear. Part bear whisperer, part bear psychologist and renowned bear expert, Phil is the ideal companion for bear viewing in Canada. Phil is often a source for the Canadian media whenever an usual bear-related event occurs. Phil will lead you into the serene wilderness surrounding the Taku River - the largest pristine watershed in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Grizzlies are normally solitary but congregate during the salmon season. The Nakina River is the birthplace of Chinook, Pink and Sockeye salmon who return to spawn. This relatively short period brings a healthy population of grizzly bears to feed as they prepare for winter hibernation.</p>
<p>Home is the Nakina River Camp, a clean but rustic base to observe the bears. The bears will continuously approach and even enter the camp on the search for salmon. In fact the bears will congregate around the camp.</p>
<p>Over three days in remote wilderness, you'll have many opportunities to view the bears, the millions of spawning salmon at your feet, other local wildlife and the hundreds of eagles circling above, also feeding on the spawning salmon. Over breakfast you can expect to see numerous bears within close range. Phil will explain their behaviour and the personalities of these fascinating animals.</p>
<p>Throughout your stay, you will walk upstream and downstream to various viewing sites. As you go, you'll see bear rubbing trees and you learn about bear forage, social behavior and their seasonal use of the river valley. This is truly one of the most intimate viewing experiences of wildlife anywhere.</p>

The Serengeti perhaps defines the safari experience as surely as the wildlife that inhabits it.

The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, when 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other game that follow close behind make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";

Visit the adjacent Maasai village, take a morning bush walk with an armed ranger or enjoy sundowners in the evening or even dinner under the stars in the middle of the African bush.<br /><br />In the Mara, the wildlife is abundant and the swaying grasslands ensure that animals are never out of sight. Elephants browse amongst the large herds of wildebeest, topi, gazelle, eland and buffalo. The plains offer a rich variety of food for the dominant predators: lion, leopard, hyena and cheetah. In the Mara River, hippos submerge while crocodiles sunbathe on the riverbanks.<br /><br />Around July to September, rain depending, the Masai Mara is host to the famous wildebeest migration which is one of the few remaining mass migrations of mammals in the world. During this time herds of over a million wildebeest will trawl their way through this region and they become the major focus for predatory activity and drama unfolds at every corner.<br /><br />There are also options for a morning balloon safari or a half-day visit to Lake Victoria.<br /><br />Balloon Safari: As the balloon is inflated against the first rays of sunrise your pilot will go through safety procedures. Once aloft, the balloon floats gently over the plains, giving a bird's eye view of the game below as the sun creeps slowly over the horizon. After around one hour the balloon lands as breakfast is already being prepared and, of course, enjoy a glass or two of bubbly to toast your flight in a tradition initiated by the Montgolfier brothers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lake Victoria Adventure : An early start this morning with a transfer to the airstrip for a flight by light aircraft to Lake Victoria. On arrival enjoy an appetising full English breakfast before you board the boat for the morning. There will be the opportunity to try fishing for the legendary giant Nile perch found in these waters as you explore the myriad of tiny islands in this region of the lake. An experienced and knowledgeable fisherman captains each boat.

Enjoy a full day exploring the Serengeti by 4WD vehicle with thrilling morning and afternoon game drives. Whether this is your first time on safari or a return trip the Serengeti will not disappoint.<br /><br />The Serengeti National Park is arguably the most famous national park in the world. The Serengeti perhaps defines the safari experience as surely as the wildlife that inhabits it. Established in 1951, and covering an area of almost 15,000 sq km, an area comparable to the state of Connecticut or Northern Ireland, the Serengeti hosts a fantastically diverse ecosystem. The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, where 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other plains game that follow close behind, make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";

This afternoon explore the Selous either by foot on a walking safari, by boat on the Rufiji and Lake Tagala, or in open 4WD vehicles. All excursions are escorted by an experienced armed guide.<br /><br />Selous Sand Rivers is situated on the banks of the Rufiji River, offering a unique combination of adventure, comfort and exclusivity. This small luxury lodge, crafted out of local materials, comprises six individually designed cottages with en-suite bathrooms. Spaced along the river bank, each has its own private view of the wide sand-banked river with its hippos, crocodiles and birdlife.

The Selous supports around one million game animals, is bigger than Switzerland and is a World Heritage site. From March to May floods sweep the valley, forcing the game on to the 'islands' of higher ground, where elephant, buffalo, lion, leopard, crocodile, puku, buck, eland, sable and others concentrate.<br /></p>";

Transfer from Arusha to Ngorongoro Crater Lodge located on the rim with spectacular views across the crater. The Ngorongoro Crater is the largest unbroken caldera in the world and the first sight of it is breathtaking.<br /><br />Ngorongoro Crater Lodge is situated on the edge of the ancient crater rim above the cool, swirling mists. The lodge is a return to the noble elegance of the travelling colonials. Inspired in design by the Maasai Manyatta, three separate camps of 6 to 12 suites each remember a bygone era when characters such as Lord Delamere adorned the stilted, handcrafted structures with graceful antiques, grand chandeliers and treasures collected from travels through Africa.<br /><br /></p>";

Enjoy a picnic lunch amongst the hippos and birds before visiting a Maasai village this afternoon.<br /><br />The floor of the crater is only 100 sq miles but is home to around 30,000 animals with a high concentration of predators and some of the finest black-maned lions in Africa. Rhinos can often be seen with calves at heel. Eland and waterbuck appear not to notice the human visitors, enabling photographers to shoot at ease. On the lake in the middle of the crater you may see thousands of flamingos fluttering and shimmering like a pink heat haze. Zebra and wildebeest account for almost half the animals. Gazelle, buffalo, eland, hartebeest and wart hog can also be seen.<br /></p>";

The camp offers spectacular views across Tortillis woodland situated on the edge of the short grass plains. The camp is comprised of nine double tents scattered around the kopje with the mess tent and common area as the central feature.
