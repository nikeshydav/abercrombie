<p>Chile is a land of extremes and astounding beauty with the largest north to south reach, with 4,350 KMs of coastline. The chili shaped country is home to theworld's driest point. The <strong>tacama Desertlies</strong> in the north, along with a rugged yet stunning landscape assorted with mountains, lakes and glaciers before it merges into the expansive ocean at Cape Horn.</p>
<p><strong>Chile travel</strong> with Abercrombie & Kent India will give you an insight into the lives of the locals and an in-depth look at places that Chile is renowned for.<br>
Torres del Paine in southern Patagonia (designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve) is Chileâ€™s most famous national park, and also a starting point for most <a href="http://www.abercrombiekent.co.in/destinations/south-america-chile-recommended-itineraries.html">Chile holidays</a>.Over 100 species of birds, armadillo, guanaco and Chileâ€™s big cat, the Puma, reside here. Witness the regionâ€™s striking beauty, surrounded with immense granite towers that plunge to a bountiful valley of lakes, waterfalls, glaciers and icebergs.
There are a number of places to visit in Chile that you absolutely cannot miss out on. The Chilean Lake District is an idyllic setting for a holiday, with the water merging seamlessly together with land, making for a dazzling view. The glistening blue lakes mirror the snow-capped volcanoes beautifully, whereas if you take a turn for the north, the <strong>Atacama Desert</strong> greets you as an adventure playground of geysers, moon valleys and salt lakes where at night the clear skies are littered with thousands of stars.<br>
Santiago is the capital of Chile, as well as a gateway to the ski areas and <strong>sandy beaches</strong>. Maipo Valley is just south of here and produces some of the finest wines, a <a href="http://www.abercrombiekent.co.in/destinations/south-america-chile-highlights.html">visit here</a> is well worth building in to your Chile holiday.  You may also drive down to Valparaiso that surrounds the city from three sides and houses the rare wine grapes such as Carmenere which made Chilean wine among the world's most famous.<br>
The best part of your <strong>Chile tour</strong> would definitely be a visit to <strong>Easter Island</strong>, a small section of land lying about 2,000 miles off the west coast of Chile. It is best known for its moai, over800 huge figures sculpted from volcanic-rock, situated on ahu, gazing out to sea. Its origin is unknown. Nobody knows exactly how, why or when they were put there. The island is one of the most isolated and mystifying places on earth and is a fitting adjunct to the spectacle of Chile.

<h1>Best Time To Go Chile</h1>
<div class="Clr"></div>

<h4>Best time to go to Chile&nbsp; </h4>
<p>With the country's vast north to south extension, Chile's climate is extremely varied.</p>
<p>
Coastal Chile enjoys a sea breeze so it generally feels cooler here than inland.  Temperatures between 5ÂºC - 10ÂºC are most common. The rainy season is from May to August when temperatures are cooler.</p>
<p>
The mountainous Lake District is cool throughout the year, enjoying a northern European climate. Here, April through June are the months of heaviest rainfall, and November through March is considered the best travel time, but is also the time of year that attracts the biggest crowds.</p>
<p>Chilean Patagonia is mainly cool, with unpredictable changes of weather throughout the year. Despite its southerly location the winter months benefit from much less wind and temperatures rarely drop much below freezing during the day. Chilean Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego have summer averages of 11Â°C (52Â°F)</p>
<p>The Atacama Desert in northern Chile is one of the Earth's driest areas and enjoys sunny weather and high temperatures all year round - ideal for the sun seeker!</p>
<p>Easter Island has a Pacific Island tropical climate that is heavily influenced by winds and ocean currents. The hottest months are January and February although good weather is available all year round.

<div class="tabtxtHolder">
<div class="tabtxtHolder-top"></div>
<div class="tabtxtHolder-mid">
<div id="tab1">
<ul class="intrestGrouplisting">
<li>In Chile the unit of currency is the Chilean Peso. Denominations are as follows: Notes: 20,000, 10,000, 5,000, 2,000, and 1,000. Coins:  500, 100, 50, 10, 5 and 1.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="tab2" style="display:none;">
<ul class="intrestGrouplisting">
<li>The easiest way to obtain cash is by using ATMs, which operate under the "Redbank" sign. These cashpoint machines take Cirrus, Visa and MasterCard and permit transactions up to US $250.00. However, they are only available in major cities.</li>
<li>US dollars may be exchanged almost anywhere. Only clean new bills should be used as most changers will closely examine all foreign bills and will reject anything that that looks remotely suspicious. It is usually unnecessary to pay a commission on cash exchanges. Many hotels and tour agencies accept US dollars. Foreign travellers who pay in dollars are exempted from paying the 19% IVA tax.</li>
<li>	Travellers cheques can be cashed at banks or exchange houses, but passports are essential for these transactions. However, in small towns and remote locations it may be difficult to find a bank that will change them. They must be changed before midday except in "Casas de Cambio" (which in any case tend to offer better rates than banks). There may be some difficulty exchanging travellers cheques outside major towns. To avoid additional exchange rate charges, travellers are advised to take cheques in US Dollars.</li>
<li>	MasterCard, Visa, American Express and Dinners club are sporadically accepted throughout the country, though visitors should not count on being able to use their credit card in rural areas. Storeowners will sometimes charge more for purchases made with a credit card.</li>
<li>	The government does not regulate the market of foreign currency in Chile. You can exchange money at any established "Casa de Cambio" at market driven exchange rates. They are common in commercial areas as well as in shopping malls.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="tab3" style="display:none;">
<ul class="intrestGrouplisting">
<li>10% is the average restaurant tip. </li>
<li>Cab drivers do not expect to be tipped, but they appreciate the fare being rounded off. </li>
<li>We pay generous amounts to hotel staff, waiters in restaurants when meals included and porterage at airports and hotels.</li> 
<li>It is therefore up to the discretion of each individual if you wish to give something extra to someone who has gone out of their way to be helpful to you.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="tab4" style="display:none;">For full details on climate, please see <a href="south-america-chile-best-time.html" title="Best Time to Go">Best Time to Go</a>.</div>
<div id="tab5" style="display:none;">
<ul class="intrestGrouplisting">
<li>No vaccinations are required to enter Chile. However, as when travelling to any country abroad, we would recommend that visitors observe a few routine precautions.</li>
<li>Tap water throughout the country is generally safe to drink, though visitors should exercise caution in rural areas and in the desert north. This means that raw fruit and vegetables may be safely consumed as long as they are properly washed.</li>
<li>	Cholera is not a problem in Chile, although random cases have been reported - usually in rural areas.</li>
<li>Mountain sickness can affect anyone at altitudes above 10,000 feet (3,000 metres).The symptoms of mountain sickness include headache, nausea and/or shortness of breath. About half of the people visiting high altitudes suffer from at least one symptom in the first two days and then quickly recover. In most cases, rest and two aspirins will relieve the discomfort. Sensible precautionary measures include sticking to a schedule of mild activity, drinking plenty of non-alcoholic fluids (up to 5 litres a day), not smoking, avoiding sedatives (such as sleeping pills or tranquilisers) which tend to depress respiration and limit oxygen intake.</li>
<li>For up to date information on latest health and vaccination recommendations, please contact your doctor.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="tab6" style="display:none;">
<ul class="intrestGrouplisting">
<li>Electric voltage is 220 volts, 50 cycles (220v 50Hz). The use of appliances or electric devices designed for 110V need the use of a transformer. Most travel appliances like notebook computers have an auto volt (110V-240V) transformer that will adapt to Chilean electricity.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="tab7" style="display:none;">
<ul class="intrestGrouplisting">
<li>A passport with at least 6 months validity is required for all foreign visitors to Chile. </li>
<li>	A 90-day tourist card is issued to all arriving visitors (normally during the flight to Santiago), and this is renewable for another 90 days at the Departamento de Extranjeria. </li>
<li>	All visitors should refer to their closest Chilean Embassy to check which visas are required, although current visa requirements may be subject to change at any time.</li>
<li>	Citizens of most Western European countries do not require a visa. US, Canadian and Australian citizens do not need a visa, but must upon arrival at Santiago's International Airport pay a  "Reciprocity Fee" that corresponds to the amount a Chilean national must pay when travelling to the United States, Canada, or Australia. Once paid, it is valid for up to 10 years. Payment must be made in cash (US Dollars or Chilean Pesos) or by credit card (VISA, MasterCard or American Express). Payment is made prior to passport control, at the "Reciprocity Fee" stand, to the left of the International Police.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="tab8" style="display:none;">
<ul class="intrestGrouplisting">
<li>With the largest Pacific coastline in the world seafood is obviously in abundance, but the quality is also exceptional. Particular national specialities include king crab from Punta Arenas, scallops, sea urchin, limpet, abalone, oysters, especially on Chiloe Island, tuna and red snapper from Easter Island, and lobster from Juan Fernandez.</li>
<li>	Inland the emphasis is on meat including great beef and lamb (a real favourite in the far south of the country). These meats are always accompanied by excellent Chilean side dishes. The empanada is great for a light meal or snack - a pastry parcel but with many different flavours available including chopped beef (pino), cheese (queso), or vegetable (verduras). Salmon and trout from the southern lakes and rivers are also popular.</li>
<li>Whatever food you choose, you will find a delightful Chilean wine to accompany it, or perhaps a Pisco Sour cocktail!</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="tab9" style="display:none;">
<ul class="intrestGrouplisting">
<li>There are an excellent variety of handicrafts available to be purchased in Chile, including woodwork, pottery, copperware, leatherwork, lapis lazuli products and Indian woven goods such as ponchos and rugs.</li>
<li>There are several handicraft markets in the Downtown, Providencia, Vitacura and Los Dominicos areas of Santiago. Generally, traditional street front shops are open from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM Monday to Friday with a midday "siesta" closure. Some are open on the weekend too, but please check with a guide or local office to avoid disappointment.
