<h4>Time Zone</h4>
<ul class="intrestGrouplisting">
<li>Most of continental Europe (including Switzerland, France, Austria, Germany, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and The Netherlands) is on GMT + 1 hour.</li>
<li>Greece operates on GMT + 2 hours.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Language</h4>
<ul class="intrestGrouplisting">
<li>Netherlands: Dutch is the official language in The Netherlands. However, English is widely spoken by many people in major centres, and many Dutch people also speak German or French.</li>
<li>Germany: German is the national language, the mother tongue of more than 110 million people. Bavarian German differs slightly from the Hochdeutsch of Germany itself, but the differences are slight. Most people who come into regular contact with visitors from overseas speak English to some degree, although English speakers can be rare in rural districts.</li>
<li>Austria: In Austria, German is the national language. Because the region was a political and cultural patchwork until the last quarter of the 19th century, Austrian (and Bavarian) German differs slightly from the Hochdeutsch of Germany itself, but the differences are slight. Most people who come into regular contact with visitors from overseas speak English to some degree, although English speakers can be rare in rural districts.</li>
<li>Greece: Modern Greek (as opposed to Ancient) is the national language of Greece. Vernacular speech contains many borrowings from foreign languages, including Italian, French, Turkish and English, so you may hear some familiar words in everyday speech. “Tourist Police” whose lapel badges picture a Union Jack or American flag speak English. In Greece, people whose work brings them into contact with visitors from overseas are generally excellent English speakers.</li>
<li>Switzerland: Switzerland, in the middle of the European continent, has four national languages: German, French, Italian and Romansh. (Romansh is an obscure Romance language spoken by only 1% of the Swiss population, shared with a small number of speakers in Italy.) The good news is that most Swiss people are, by necessity, multilingual. Fluency in six or seven languages isn’t uncommon. Most people can manage at least a little English, and about 1 in 10 are fluent English speakers.</li>
<li>Czech: Czech, national language of the Czech Republic is a Slavic language with a long literary history, dating back to the 14th century. Most people who come into regular contact with visitors from overseas speak English to some degree, although English speakers can be rare in rural districts.</li>
<li>Hungary: Hungary’s official language is Hungarian, an isolated member of the Finno-Ugrian group. Hungarian’s non-European grammar, unique sounds, and reliance on accent to determine the meaning of a word make it a notoriously difficult language to learn. Most people who come into regular contact with visitors from overseas speak English to some degree, although English speakers can be rare in rural districts.</li>
<li>Poland: Polish is a member of the West Slavic language group and has several regional dialects, which correspond to old tribal divisions and the inimitable influence by contact with foreign languages. Considered one of the more difficult languages to learn for non-native speakers it has complicated system of inflections (words change meaning according to their function, number or gender). However, most people who come into regular contact with visitors from overseas speak English to some degree. English speakers can be rare, however, in rural districts.

<ul class="intrestGrouplisting">
<li>Netherlands, Germany, Austria and Greece: Travellers cheques can easily be converted into Euros; some larger stores will take them as payment. Smaller denominations are preferred. Major credit cards are widely accepted (though American Express less so) and ATM access is widespread.</li>
<li>	Switzerland: Travellers cheques and major credit cards are sometimes accepted (although less so in some rural cantons), and ATM outlets are numerous.</li>
<li>	Czech Republic: Although travellers cheques are accepted at major hotels, payment by major credit card is the more common practice at high-end shops. Czech currency is, in general, the preferred method of payment. Some specialty shops will also accept US Dollars or Euros. </li>
<li>	Hungary: Travellers cheques (smaller denominations preferred) are accepted for exchange at hotels and banks. Major credit cards can be used at hotels, and most restaurants and shops (American Express has limited acceptability). ATM outlets are numerous.</li>
<li>	Poland: Travellers cheques can be exchanged easily. Credit card use is not as widespread as in other European countries, although up-scale hotels and restaurants, as well as car rental agencies do accept major cards. Currency exchange agents are located in the major cities and tourist areas (American Express, Thomas Cook). ATM machines are located at all major banks, but may be limited to bank hours and possibly closed on weekends. Exchange currency only at authorised outlets such as banks and hotels, in currency exchanges called “kantor,” commonly found in most Polish cities. </li>

<div id="tab5" style="display:none;">
<ul class="intrestGrouplisting">
<li>Conservative “smart casual” clothing will be most useful for daytime touring. European street wear tends to be somewhat more formal (especially in larger cities) than is usual elsewhere. While jeans are acceptable daytime wear, “smart casual” attire - stylish slacks or skirt outfit for women and a shirt with collar and slacks for men – will be more appropriate for evening eating out at mid priced restaurants and above. </li>
<li>	Cotton and other light fabrics are comfortable choices for summertime in most European countries, though we recommend you carry a sweater and/or light jacket in case of cool breezes or unseasonal weather. Spring and autumn temperatures dictate medium-weight clothing selections and in winter you will need a pullover and a coat. In inland regions, winters can be very cold and so heavy duty clothing – suitable for snowy environments - is recommended for sightseeing outdoors. In southern European countries, summer times are very hot and lightweight cotton clothing is recommended. Some light coloured cotton long-sleeved/long-legged clothing is recommended for protection against the sun, as is a sunhat.</li>
<li>	When dining at better restaurants and for any special occasion during your journey, dress is more formal. For gentlemen, a “jacket and tie” standard is appropriate, with an equivalent standard of eveningwear for ladies.</li>
<li>	Bring comfortable walking shoes with low or no heels. An umbrella or light raincoat may come in handy, especially in the north of the country.</li>
<li>	Cathedrals, churches and other religious sites require conservative dress. Both sexes should cover their arms, legs and shoulders.</li>
