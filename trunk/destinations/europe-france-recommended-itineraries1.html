A five day VIP trip to Paris.<br />
<strong>Highlights:</strong> Paris, Versailles </p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>PARIS</h5>
<p>Upon arrival at Paris airport you will be welcomed to France by your local Guardian Angel as you exit customs into the arrivals hall, and transferred to your hotel where you will be assisted with check-in procedures.</p>
<p>
A lunch reservation will be made for you at the Jules Verne restaurant (lunch payable directly).  A private elevator will transport you to the inner sanctum whose cushy black carpet, black walls, and black-crossbarred chairs set off by gleaming, crisp white tablecloths were designed by Slavik to make the diners feel part of the tower itself.  We will try to reserve a table near the window to allow you to experience the magnificent view to the full. Classic French cuisine with chic and professional service is offered in this restaurant.</p>
<p>
This afternoon enjoy a special visit to the Opera de Paris which has been housed in Garnier Palace since its completion by architect Garnier in 1875 following the orders of Napoleon III. The beauty of the Opera Garnier, its marble Grand Staircase; the gold, the mosaics and the magnificent painted ceiling of the Grand Foyer; the immense crystal chandelier (weighing 8 tons) and Marc Chagall's ceiling of the Italian-style Auditorium are renowned all over the world. Your privately guided visit will take you through the famous public spaces - an hour and a half of insider anecdotes and the history tailing the artistic and social highlights of the era. A glorious visit not to be missed!  After your tour you will be transferred back to your hotel.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Hotel Plaza Athenee</p>

<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>PARIS</h5>
<p>Today you will be met at your hotel by a Paris restaurant critic and food expert, who will spend the morning with you pointing you to some of the best food suppliers in Paris during your 3 hour walking tour. During your tour there are a number of different possibilities according to your interests.  For example you might visit a world-renowned boulangerie where you will meet the baker and learn about the French art of breadbaking or you may have a glimpse at the life of a dedicated chocolatier who trained with the very best.  </p>
<p>
In the afternoon you will enjoy a half day (up to 5 hours) sightseeing tour to Versailles with your private vehicle and English-speaking guide.  You will drive out to Versailles to admire the huge palace of the great Sun King Louis XIV, visiting the State Apartments and decorative gardens.</p>

Visit of the recently re-opened Musèe de l' Orangerie, which houses Monet's magnificent "Water Lily" paintings. Afterwards go up to the hill of Montmartre where many painters lived and worked and where, today, artists still gather.</p>
<p>
This afternoon you will have the opportunity to learn firsthand about refined table manners in a most exclusive setting. You will start with a private lesson in French Table Etiquette travelling by private vehicle to the Parisian apartments of a High society socialite (a Princess) who has educated generations on formal Protocol.  Her apartments are aristocratically furnished with family portraits.</p>
<p>
In the early evening you will leave Paris for a dinner with your evening's hosts - noble descendants of Colbert, the powerful Minister of Louis XIV.  They will welcome you into their historic 18th Century Château du Saussay that still belongs to the family and will give you a personal tour of their ancestral home (which includes magnificent Colbert library) and its landscaped park. The candlelit dinner will take place in the formal dinning room where you will have the opportunity to get to know the Barons while experimenting refined table manners, gastronomic cuisine prepared for you by a renowned Parisian Chef and the elegant 18th Century setting of the Château which was the film location for "Dangerous Liasons" staring Glenn Close and John Malkovich.  After dinner you will be privately transferred back to Paris.</p>

The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, when 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other game that follow close behind make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";

Elephants browse amongst the large herds of wildebeest, topi, gazelle, eland and buffalo. The plains offer a rich variety of food for the dominant predators: lion, leopard, hyena and cheetah. In the Mara River, hippos submerge while crocodiles sunbathe on the riverbanks.<br /><br />Around July to September, rain depending, the Masai Mara is host to the famous wildebeest migration which is one of the few remaining mass migrations of mammals in the world. During this time herds of over a million wildebeest will trawl their way through this region and they become the major focus for predatory activity and drama unfolds at every corner.<br /><br />There are also options for a morning balloon safari or a half-day visit to Lake Victoria.<br /><br />Balloon Safari: As the balloon is inflated against the first rays of sunrise your pilot will go through safety procedures. Once aloft, the balloon floats gently over the plains, giving a bird's eye view of the game below as the sun creeps slowly over the horizon. After around one hour the balloon lands as breakfast is already being prepared and, of course, enjoy a glass or two of bubbly to toast your flight in a tradition initiated by the Montgolfier brothers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lake Victoria Adventure : An early start this morning with a transfer to the airstrip for a flight by light aircraft to Lake Victoria. On arrival enjoy an appetising full English breakfast before you board the boat for the morning. There will be the opportunity to try fishing for the legendary giant Nile perch found in these waters as you explore the myriad of tiny islands in this region of the lake. An experienced and knowledgeable fisherman captains each boat.

<h5>PARIS - CHABLIS - VEZELAY</h5>
<p>Upon arrival at the Paris airport you will be welcomed to France in the arrivals hall by your English- speaking wine expert guide, who will accompany you throughout your tour of Burgundy.</p>
<p>
On your way to Burgundy stop in Chablis, the most northerly and insular of 'Burgundian Wine regions'; here the Chardonnay grape and the clay soil produce delicate wines with considerable finesse, there are seven different Grand Cru vineyards in the Chablis appellation. It is here that you will be able to enjoy tasting of the distinct wines of the region at Domaine William Févre. The Domain is set within 47 hectares of skillfully harvested vineyards in the heart of Chablis.  Afterwards continue deeper into the countryside of Burgundy, stopping to walk in the valley of the River Serein, before arriving this evening at the foot of the 'holy' hill of Vézelay to check into your celebrated hotel, Hotel de l'Espérance.</p>
<p>This evening a reservation will be made for you at your hotel to sample the cooking of Marc Mènaud, the owner of the hotel and one of the founders of la nouvelle cuisine française.  Marc Mènaud was born in the village and knows all the flavors of the region and you may like to have a local Vezelay wine to accompany your meal.</p>

<p>
Later morning you will stop in a wine workshop (not available on Sundays) and for a lunch at Olivier Leflaive's estate. In 1984 Olivier Leflaive, with help from his uncle Vincent Leflaive, set up his own wine nègociant business, which he continues to manage to this day. With the help of winemaker Jean-Marc Boillot, Olivier Leflaive produced wines of quality from the outset. In 1988 Franck Grux took over as winemaker and continues in this role. Over the two decades quality has continued to improve, and Olivier Leflaive has established a reputation as a small nègociant of high quality. Leflaive has expanded with the purchase of several vineyards, building up a range of domaine wines alongside the nègoce bottlings. Olivier Leflaive owns vines in the Premier Cru vineyards of Les Chaumèes, Les Vergers and Abbaye de Morgeot (all Chassagne Montrachet), and Les Poruzots (Meursault). As well as running the family business producing wines from his estate, he is renowned for his Table-d'Hôtes, where you will be invited today for lunch and a wine tasting.</p>

Enjoy a full day exploring the Serengeti by 4WD vehicle with thrilling morning and afternoon game drives. Whether this is your first time on safari or a return trip the Serengeti will not disappoint.<br /><br />The Serengeti National Park is arguably the most famous national park in the world. The Serengeti perhaps defines the safari experience as surely as the wildlife that inhabits it. Established in 1951, and covering an area of almost 15,000 sq km, an area comparable to the state of Connecticut or Northern Ireland, the Serengeti hosts a fantastically diverse ecosystem. The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, where 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other plains game that follow close behind, make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";

The Selous supports around one million game animals, is bigger than Switzerland and is a World Heritage site.

Transfer from Arusha to Ngorongoro Crater Lodge located on the rim with spectacular views across the crater. The Ngorongoro Crater is the largest unbroken caldera in the world and the first sight of it is breathtaking.<br /><br />Ngorongoro Crater Lodge is situated on the edge of the ancient crater rim above the cool, swirling mists. The lodge is a return to the noble elegance of the travelling colonials. Inspired in design by the Maasai Manyatta, three separate camps of 6 to 12 suites each remember a bygone era when characters such as Lord Delamere adorned the stilted, handcrafted structures with graceful antiques, grand chandeliers and treasures collected from travels through Africa.<br /><br /></p>";

Rhinos can often be seen with calves at heel. Eland and waterbuck appear not to notice the human visitors, enabling photographers to shoot at ease. On the lake in the middle of the crater you may see thousands of flamingos fluttering and shimmering like a pink heat haze. Zebra and wildebeest account for almost half the animals.
