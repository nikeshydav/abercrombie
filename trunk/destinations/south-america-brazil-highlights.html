<dt><h2>AMAZON </h2> 
<p>The Amazon rainforest covers most of the Amazon Basin of South America. This basin encompasses 7 million sq kms, of which 5½ million sq kms are covered by the rainforest. This region includes territory belonging to nine nations, with 60% of the forest is contained within Brazil, the main Amazon cities being Belem and Manaus.  
</p>
<div class="thepet"><p>Manaus is also home to the world famous opera house, built during the rubber boom of the late 1800s.  

The Amazon represents over half of the planet's remaining rainforests, and it comprises the largest and most species-rich tract of tropical rainforest in the world.  The fauna is the characteristic of the closed equatorial jungle; the jaguar or onca is the biggest animal to be found and other mamals include primates, cervides, and big rodents, like antas and capivaras.  There are several species of birds, particularly macaws.  Not forgetting that The Amazon is home to the biggest collection of insects on Earth. </p> 
<p>Flowing through the rainforest is the Amazon River; the largest river in the world by volume, with a total river flow greater than the next top eight largest rivers combined. The Amazon, which has the largest drainage basin in the world, accounts for approximately one fifth of the world's total river flow. During the wet season The Amazon is 120-130 miles (190-210 km) wide. Because of its vast dimensions, it is sometimes called The River Sea.</p>

<dt><h2>Bahia </h2> 
<p>Bahia 'the land of happiness', is one of 26 states in Brazil, and is located in the north eastern part of the country on the Atlantic coast.  With a coastline of 1,000kms long, it offers endless sandy beaches and an ideal climate for escaping to the sun year-round.</p>
<div class="thepet"><p>Capital of the state, Salvador da Bahia is a 'must see' heady mix of stunning colonial buildings, beautiful beaches, cobbled streets, African culture and pulsating musical rhythms. On the strength of the export of sugar and the import of African slaves, Salvador became one of the most important places in the Portuguese Empire. Today it is a city of forts, catholic churches, 'condomble' temples and a fascinating mix of old and new, African and European, religious and profane.</p>
<p>
The 'Bahians' are a very friendly people and you can be sure of a good welcome on your visit to Bahia. Talk to one of our experts today so they can design your perfect Bahia Holidays.</p>

<dt><h2>Beach</h2> 
<p>For most Brazilians, life does not get better than the arrival of the weekend, time to head to the beach for a footvolley game or a barbeque. With thousands of miles of coastline, there are many spectacular places to stay in Brazil. Choose from remote island retreats, elegant and exclusive resorts, charming barefoot boutique guesthouses or glamorously fully-staffed villas with private speedboat at your disposal.</p>
<div class="thepet"><p>Perhaps the best known of Brazil's beaches and bays are found in the vibrant little resort of Buzios, a couple of hours drive north of Rio and also along Brazil's beautiful Costa Verde between Rio and Sao Paulo, such as the charming colonial village of Paraty. Combine the vibrant city of Rio de Janeiro easily with a tranquil beach stay before flying home. Talk to one of our experts today so they can design your perfect Brazil Beach Holidays.

<dt><h2> Florianopolis</h2> 
<p>Florianopolis is the capital of the island, Santa Catarina.  Surrounded by 42 beaches, it has a landscape sprinkled with lakes, sand dunes and small islands along its coast. The waves are so good that both national and international surfing championships are held here. </p>
<div class="thepet"><p>Steeped in history, Florianopolis boasts a series of fortresses built to withstand invasion by the Spanish and Dutch during the 16th and 17th centuries. Originally colonized by the Azorian Portuguese, Florianópolis retains many traces of its early years. The small village of Santo Antônio de Lisboa is an example of the architecture of that period and in Ribeirão da Ilha, the oldest part of the capital, the inhabitants still speak the Azorean dialect, which is difficult to understand at first.</p>
<p>Cuisine has become more sophisticated over the years, due to the Brazilians and foreigners who moved here and includes delicious seafood, all caught locally. Talk to one of our experts today so they can design your perfect Florianopolis Holidays.</p>

<dt><h2>IGUACU</h2> 
<p>The Iguaçu Falls bordering the southern state of Parana, Argentina and Paraguay are probably the most impressive sight in Brazil, if not in the whole of South America and are considered to be one of the natural wonders of the world.  Approximately 275 individual waterfalls combine to form this spectacular sight; a waterfall nearly 3 km in length with a deafening sound that can be heard from miles away.</p>
<div class="thepet"><p>As well as the falls themselves, Iguaçu National Park has a lot to offer. The vegetation in the surrounding area is incredibly lush and the sub-tropical climate makes it a superb location for bird watching, as well as being a 'hotspot' for huge numbers of butterflies and orchids.  The landscape in the south changes and is subtropical, with pines rather than palms and the terrain is more rugged but very fertile. It is in the south that Brazil's grain is grown, where the gauchos live and where the cattle herds roam. The people here are rather different too and of a more European extraction.</p>
<p>These spectacular falls can be experienced in many ways, but for the more adventurous we would recommend that there is no better way to take in the vast area of the falls than by helicopter.</p>

<dd><img src="../images/brazil-highlight6.jpg" alt="Pantanal" /></dd>
<dt><h2>Pantanal</h2> 
<p>Almost 10  times the size of the Everglades and the world's largest freshwater wetland, the Pantanal serves as a lush reservoir which thousands of species of exotic plants and a highly concentrated, diverse mix of animals call home. With the biggest concentration of large animals in the New World, the Pantanal counts jaguars, giant otters, anacondas, caimans, hawks, macaws, marsh deer, tapirs, egrets, herons, monkeys, and ibis as a few of its many species of inhabitants. </p>
<div class="thepet"><p>Heavy, seasonal rainfalls and flooding characterize the region and allow for the thriving growth of wildlife. And thrive it does; the Pantanal is home to over 700 species of birds (and is also an important migratory area for North American birds), 100 species of mammals, 260 species of fish and 80 reptile species. This environment sets the stage for one of the best bird and wildlife-spotting experiences imaginable. For the best times to go, please see below.</p>
<p>
One of the best ways to explore the Pantanal is as the locals do; on horseback. There are very few roads that exist in the Pantanal and horses can carry you into areas that otherwise couldn't be reached due to flooding and other conditions. Other methods of transportation are usually boats, four wheel drive trucks, and the occasional footpath. </p>
<p>
When is the best time to visit Pantanal?</p>
<p>
The scenery of the Pantanal changes with every new season, but it remains always exuberant. Each one of the seasons has its own characteristics, varies year-to-year according to the presence or absence of rain. The average annual precipitation is 1500mm, the majority of which falls between the months of November and March.</p>
<p>
Wet Season (January through March): With the summer rains, as parts of the Pantanal are flooded, the fauna and flora reinvigorate and Pantanal reveals one of its most lively seasons. The main characteristics of this season are the beautiful water landscapes, and many water birds such as the Jabiru Stork, Woodstorks, Limpkins, ducks, teals and egrets. Among the common mammals we can find the Capybaras, Crab-eating Foxes, and the Grey-brocket and Pampas deer. The water plants are in bloom with different shapes and colors throughout the lakes and rivers. Also abundant are butterflies and other interesting insects. The wet season is also the best time to watch the most beautiful sunset of the year.</p>
<p>
Intermediate Season (April through June): In April, the rains stop and the water level begin to recede, giving rise to lagoons and water puddles. Here, thousands of fish are trapped, providing a food banquet for the water birds which concentrate in these regions. The temperature becomes milder and the night skies are filled with stars. The mammals, which dispersed in the wet season, start to come back and show themselves. Species such as the White-lipped Peccaries, Collared Peccaries, Marsh Deer and the Howler and Capuchin Monkeys can often be seen. </p>
<p>
Dry Season (July through October): The best time to observe wildlife. The lack of rain diminishes the lagoons, revealing the flat grounds and aiding transportation by land. The fields begin to dry, providing vast grazing areas where mammals search for food and water in the remaining water puddles. From August on, the Tabebuia trees blossom - locally known as Piuvas (with pink flowers) and Paratudos (yellow flowers). This is the breeding season for birds - their plumage is at their best condition and their calls can be heard throughout the Pantanal. This is also the best season to observe Giant Anteaters, Crab-eating Racoons and South-American Coatis.
</p>
<p>
Rainy Season (November through December): The period when there is a lot of rain in the Pantanal, but not enough to flood. Due to the long dry season, it takes a while for the soil to saturate to the point of flooding. It is also a season of a great abundance of food for birds that started their breeding in the past months. It is very common to see chicks being fed by their parents.</p>

<dt><h2> Rio de Janeiro</h2> 
<p>Rio de Janeiro is the Brazilian tourism capital, with a population of 6 million. Known by its inhabitants, the Cariocas, as the "Cidade Maravilhosa", its reputation precedes it. Images explode forth of stunning mountains, glittering carnival costumes, the statue of Christ's welcoming outspread arms, skimpy bikinis and the endless rhythm of samba.   </p>
<div class="thepet">
<p> However, behind all the glitz and glamour, this wonderful city, located in the Southeast Region of Brazil, is also rich in history and culture.  There are many fine buildings, historical neighbourhoods and museums from its time as the capital of Brazil.</p>
<p>The view of Rio from Corcovado Mountain is world famous.  710 metres high, Corcovado is crowned by the statue of Christ the Redeemer, which is 30 metres high and has an 8 metre pedestal with a chapel in honour of the Lady of Aparecida, patron Saint of Brazil.</p>
<p>In Rio, the more you explore the more there is and the Cariocas are very friendly and welcoming people, guaranteeing to make your Brazil holiday a memorable one.</p>

<dt><h2>Sao Paulo Tours</h2> 
<p>Sao Paulo overwhelms the senses with its sheer size. With over 10 million inhabitants, it is the world's third largest city and the largest in South America. Sao Paulo and its rival Brazilian city, Rio de Janeiro, have often been compared to New York and Los Angeles respectively. </p>
<div class="thepet">
<p>If Rio has gained fame for its striking natural setting, Sao Paulo's attraction lies in its people and its vibrant cultures. The Avenida Paulista's canyon of upthrusting skyscrapers only hints at the city's sources of energy. A more cosmopolitan city than its counterpart, Sao Paulo possesses significant ethnic minority communities, including substantial Japanese, Italian, and Arab and Lebanese Christian neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>A Gourmand's delight Sao Paulo is legendary for its array of different nationality restaurants.  Japanese, Italian nuova cucina, Brazilian, Chinese, Jewish, and Arab restaurants are all familiar parts of the city's landscape. Brazil's famously good beef is put to good use at the numerous rodizios and churrascarias. Succulent, roasted cuts of meat are circulated around the tables and cut to patrons' order. In fact, people often visit Sao Paulo just to dine out.</p>
<p>Brazil's most modern, cosmopolitan city has much to offer in addition to its outstanding cuisines. Its museums are amongst the finest in South America, its surrounding coastline is graced with many lovely beaches and its entertainment and nightlife have for years attracted some of the best performers in the world.</p>

<dd><img src="../images/brazil-highlight9.jpg" alt="The North" /></dd>
<dt><h2>The North</h2> 
<p>The Northern Region of Brazil was the last region to be given importance by the Brazilian government, but makes up 45% of the entire size of the country.  However, it still remains the least inhabited and most unexplored part of Brazil. </p>
<div class="thepet">
<p>The sun drenched north east, known as Nordeste in Portuguese (which is the local language), has plenty to offer with its colonial architecture, tropical climate, folk art, fishing and local crafts. </p>
<p>Arguably some of Brazil's best beaches are found in Natal in the north eastern region, which incidentally was used as the American military base in world war II.  Many of these beaches are so secluded that the only way to reach them is by dune buggy.  These vehicles come with driver included and you can choose an "emotional" or "un-emotional" ride!</p>
<p>Another beautiful beach can be found at the tiny fishing village of Porto de Galinhas (the crude translation of which is "Chickens Port"). In olden times, "chicken" was a codeword for the illegal slave cargo that was being smuggled into the harbour. Despite its dark history the beach is spectacular and is protected by reefs creating many natural bathing pools.  </p>
<p>If it is cultural heritage you seek, a visit to Olinda will not disappoint you with its 20 Baroque churches, convents and numerous small chapels.  Olinda is built on a hill amidst lush tropical vegetation that sweeps down to the sea and as you wander up and down the steep streets you are surrounded by colonial architecture.</p>
<p>Throughout the north of Brazil there are local markets, buzzing with colour, selling cashews, leather goods, lace, hammocks, t-shirts, sand art and even brightly coloured fish to hang on your wall.  The surrounding trees are alive with the sound of the tropical birds that nest in them.</p>
