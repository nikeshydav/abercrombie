<div class="tabtxtHolder-mid">
<div id="tab1"><p>In Tanzania, the unit of currency is the Tanzanian Shilling, which is divided into 100 Cents. Notes are issued in denominations of 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, and 10000 Shillings. Coins are issued in denominations of 50, 100 and 200 Shillings.</p></div>
<div id="tab2" style="display:none;"><p>There are no restrictions on the amount of foreign currency that may be taken into Tanzania, and a declaration of foreign currency is no longer required. It is suggested that you save all receipts from your currency exchange transactions in Tanzania, even though they are no longer regularly inspected at departure.</p>
<p>We urge you to try to spend all of your Tanzanian Shillings while you are in Tanzania because the reverse exchange rate from Shillings back to Dollars is very unfavourable. Be aware that only paper currency will normally be accepted for exchange.</p>
<p>Tanzania has a cash-based economy, and the US Dollar is one of the most preferred currencies. Cash is more readily accepted than travellers cheques, which can be difficult to exchange; and it is suggested that you carry more cash than travellers cheques for the Tanzanian portion of your trip. An amount of at least US $200 in smaller denominations ($50 notes and smaller) is suggested. Travellers cheques should be better-known brands and also in smaller denominations.</p>
<p>Credit cards are accepted on a limited basis; most hotels, restaurants, and shops in larger cities accept at least one variety of major credit card such as Visa, MasterCard, or American Express. In Tanzania, some credit card use is subject to a surcharge of 5% to 10% of the cost of the item. Those travelling on one of our  programmes  using mobile tented camps should also be aware that credit cards are not accepted in camp.</p>
</div>
<div id="tab3" style="display:none;">
<p>Porters: A tip of US $1.00 per person is appropriate for two pieces of baggage at airports, hotels, lodges and camps. If you are travelling with more than two pieces of baggage, an additional tip of US$1.00 per bag is recommended.</p>
<p>Driver-Guide: One driver-guide accompanies each land vehicle on safari. It is customary to tip your driver-guide on the last day you are with him or her. Approximately US $5 - US $7 per traveller per day is considered a good tip for a driver-guide (based on 4 - 6 travellers in a vehicle). If there are only 2 or 3 travellers in a vehicle, you may consider raising this amount to approximately US $6 - US $8 per traveller per day in recognition of the individual attention given to a smaller size group.</p>
<p>Safari Escort: In addition to a driver-guide, some groups are accompanied by a professional safari escort. It is customary to tip your safari escort on the last day you are with him or her, and the recommended tip is US $8 to US $10 per traveller, per day. As with the tip for a driver guide, smaller groups (in this case, 5 or less) might consider tipping slightly more - in the range of approximately US $10 - US $12 per traveller per day.</p>
<p>Mobile Camping: If you are travelling on a mobile camping safari (either independently or on a programme) you will be served by a camp manager and several staff, for whom an overall tip of US $10 - US $14 per traveller per day in camp is recommended. This should be given to your guide on the last day for distribution among all camp staff. Again, smaller groups (in the case of 5 or less) might consider tipping in the slightly higher range of approximately US $12 - US $18 per traveller, per day (this applies to the exclusive camps, where tips are not included and not to the permanent tented camps).</p></div>
<div id="tab4" style="display:none;">For full details on climate, please see <a href="africa-tanzania-best-time.html" title="Best Time to Go">Best Time to Go</a>.</div>
<div id="tab5" style="display:none;"><p>Dress on safari is entirely casual.  Because it can be dusty, neutral colours are most practical for gameviewing. Please note, however, that it is illegal to wear actual "camouflage" clothing in Tanzania's parks and game reserves.  Some travellers prefer to wear older clothing on game drives because of the heavy dust that is sometimes encountered.  In general, you should dress for outdoor comfort in Tanzania, where there are no occasions for dressy or formal attire.</p>

<p>There is no need to bring a great deal of clothing.  Efficient and inexpensive laundry service is available at camp as well at most lodges and hotels in Tanzania. By using it, you can limit yourself to just four or five outfits and not be inconvenienced by an over-abundance of luggage.</p>

<p>Temperatures tend to be cooler in the early morning and after sunset - but warm up considerably by midday.  To be prepared for such temperature variations and to maximise the versatility of your travel wardrobe, we recommend packing lightweight clothing that can be layered.  Casual clothing of "breathable" fabric (such as cotton) is the most comfortable.</p>

<p>Travellers who are visiting Ngorongoro Crater should pack a lined jacket or warm sweater. Those visiting the Crater during June, July, and/or August should be prepared for cold temperatures and pack a heavier jacket, sweater, and pair of slacks -- or even a set of silk or thermal underwear.</p>
<p>Rain protection (fold-up umbrella or lightweight raincoat) may be useful, especially if you are travelling during November or from mid-March through May.</p>
<p>Tanzania has a large Muslim population in its coastal areas and on the island of Zanzibar.  Modesty of dress is expected in these places.  Slacks are entirely acceptable, but short skirts and bare arms should be avoided.  Scarves must be worn over the head (and shoes removed) when entering a mosque.</p>
<p>Unless you have booked a walking safari, you will not need heavy footwear. There is little walking when gameviewing is done from a vehicle. A pair of comfortable walking shoes with soft soles will be adequate.</p>
<p>Beach sandals are handy as slippers and will be particularly useful to those participating in camping safaris.</p>
<p>Good sunglasses and sunblock lotion are essential for protection from Tanzania's strong sun.  You may also want to bring your own fold-up sun hat.  Some hotels and lodges have swimming pools, so you may want to bring a swimsuit.  Insect repellent containing the active ingredient "DEET" should be included to supplement your malaria medication.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, the roads can be dusty on safari.  It is suggested that you pack a scarf or bandana with which to cover your nose and mouth if dusty conditions prevail.  Those who are particularly bothered by dust may want to pack a surgical mask and/or allergy medication.</p>
<p>Binoculars will maximise the enjoyment of gameviewing and bird watching.  A compact and lightweight pair is suggested.  We urge you to pack a small flashlight as the electric generators at some lodges are turned off after 10:00 or 11:00 PM.</p>
<p>If you wear prescription glasses or contact lenses, we recommend that you bring an extra pair of glasses, a copy of the prescription, and eye drops (for lubrication in especially dusty areas).</p>
</div>
<div id="tab6" style="display:none;">
<p>No vaccinations are currently required for entry into Tanzania when arrival is directly from North America or Europe.</p>

<p>Yellow Fever: If you are arriving in Tanzania (or planning to re-enter) from an area that is infected with yellow fever or arriving from a country where yellow fever is endemic (such as Kenya, Sudan, or Uganda), you are required to have a yellow fever vaccination; and it must be administered at least ten days before your arrival (or re-entry) into Tanzania.  If your travel itinerary requires you to have a yellow fever vaccination, you must ask your doctor to provide you with an "International Certificate of Vaccination," which should be carried with you while travelling to serve as proof that you have fulfilled the vaccination requirement.  If proof of vaccination is required and you do not carry it with you, you may be denied entry into Tanzania.  Please note that, even if you are not required to obtain a yellow fever vaccination for your safari in Tanzania, the CDC recommends vaccination if you are travelling outside of urban areas.</p>

<p>Cholera:  Local authorities in countries that are affected or threatened by cholera sometimes require evidence of cholera vaccination as a condition of entry.  Tanzanian officials occasionally ask to see evidence of cholera vaccination if you are arriving (or planning to re-enter) Tanzania within eight days of having travleled in an area infected with cholera such as Kenya, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Uganda, Asia, Indonesia, South America, Central America, parts of eastern Europe, etc.</p>

<p>Malaria:  Anti-malarial medication is strongly recommended for all travellers to Tanzania.  A number of anti-malarial drugs are available, including mefloquine, chloroquine, doxycycline and the new Malarone, which has performed well in recent tests. Your doctor will prescribe the best choice based on your own health history and your specific destination(s) in Africa. (In most sub-Saharan countries, for example, the prevalent strain of malaria is resistant to chloroquine.)<br />
In addition to an anti-malarial drug regimen, personal protection measures should be taken to avoid mosquito bites, especially (but not limited to) the hours between dusk and dawn when malarial mosquitos are most active.  These measures include using an insect repellent containing at least 20% to 35% of the active ingredient "DEET;" keeping your arms and legs covered as much as possible; and avoiding the use of perfume, hairspray, and other scented products that attract mosquitos. NOTE:  Since some lodges in Tanzania are not equipped with screened windows or mosquito netting, it is especially important that you carry insect repellent -- or purchase some in Arusha (or Nairobi) before venturing out into the bush.</p>
<p>Additional information on malaria prevention will be sent with your pre-tour materials.</p>

<p>Dengue Fever: Dengue fever occurs occasionally in East Africa.  Mosquitos that transmit dengue fever, which is predominant in urban centres, are usually found near human dwellings and are often present indoors.  Epidemic transmission (when international travellers are at greatest risk) is usually seasonal and occurs during and shortly after the rainy season.  There is no vaccine for dengue; therefore, travellers should take adequate precautions against mosquito bites, including the use of an insect repellent containing approximately 30% of the active ingredient "DEET."</p>

<p>We recommend that all international travellers ensure that their tetanus, Hepatitis A, and polio vaccines are up-to-date.</p>
<p>For up to date information on latest health and vaccination recommendations, please contact your doctor.</p>
</div>
<div id="tab7" style="display:none;">
<p>In Tanzania, electricity runs at 220/240 volts. If you are taking battery-powered appliances with you, please ensure you bring a large stock of spare batteries - as good quality batteries are often very difficult to come across.</p></div>
<div id="tab8" style="display:none;">
<p>We recommend that you bring all the photographic equipment you will need from home, including an ample supply of film and additional camera batteries. Film and camera batteries are available in Tanzania but are expensive and can be difficult to find in safari areas.</p>

<p>For most travellers, an African safari is the "trip of a lifetime."  Therefore, you should consider bringing more than one camera so that, if one malfunctions, all is not lost.</p>

<p>Generally, a 35mm camera is considered the best type.  For photographing birds and game, a telephoto lens is indispensable; and we recommend 200mm as the minimum size.  Tripods are generally impractical, because photographs are usually taken from your safari vehicle.  Sun filters are suggested for blocking the sun's glare and the haze caused by heat.  A dustproof camera bag (or some ziplock plastic bags) and an air brush will help protect your equipment from heavy dust.</p>

<p>We recommend carrying several speeds of film, including ASA100 for outdoor photographs in full bright daylight and ASA400 for early morning and evening photography.  Several rolls of ASA200 could also be useful for late afternoon photographs.  (Remember to change the ASA setting on your camera when you change film types.)  Keep your film as cool as possible while travelling, and never leave it in direct sunlight or on the hot floor of a safari vehicle.</p>
<p>We do not recommend having your film developed in Africa, as the quality of development is generally poor.</p>
<p>When photographing people, always ask permission first.  The only exception to this is when you are photographing a public scene with a lot of people in it, aiming at no one in particular.  Because so many local people are asked for permission to be photographed, many will expect a tip or an outright fee for this.  (In fact, some "professional posers" make a living this way.)  Always be considerate of anyone's desire not to be photographed. If you are uncertain about whether or not photography is permitted, ask.  Taking photographs when permission is not granted is inconsiderate at best and may result in the confiscation of your film.</p>
<p>While gameviewing in parks and reserves, some travellers get caught up in the excitement of the moment to the point of losing their sensitivity to the wildlife they are observing and the other people sharing their safari vehicle.  Please be careful not to disturb the animals by making unnecessary noises or commotion, and be conscious of sharing the best photographic views with others in your vehicle. Remember to be respectful of wildlife and the fragile ecosystem you have entered.</p>
</div>
<div id="tab9" style="display:none;"><p>The food served in Tanzania has greatly improved in recent years.  All lodges and hotels serve Western food, along with a selection of local dishes.</p>
<p>Several types of beer are brewed locally in Tanzania, and they are quite good.  Occasional lack of refrigeration and short supplies of ice can mean that beer and other types of drinks may be served warm or only slightly cooled.  There are imported wines in Tanzania, though specific brands cannot be guaranteed.  A limited supply of soft drinks are available.</p>
<p>Hard liquor, decaffeinated beverages and diet (sugar-free) drinks are in short supply in Tanzania; and you may not find your favourite brands.  If you favour a particular brand of spirits, you may want to use your duty-free liquor allowance to purchase a bottle en route to Tanzania for your personal consumption.  Similarly, those with a preference for decaffeinated coffee or tea may want to carry packets of these beverages.</p>
<p>Do not drink or brush your teeth with the tap water in Tanzania.  Additionally, do not accept ice in drinks.  It may be necessary to exercise caution when using "purified" water that is provided in thermoses and flasks in hotel rooms, at lodges, and at camps.  It is generally safer to drink directly from the can or bottle of a beverage than from a questionable container.  We suggest that you drink only boiled or bottled water.</p>
<p>You should avoid possibly contaminated food, particularly seafood, unwashed vegetables, and fruits that are already peeled when they are served.  In warm, tropical settings, also exercise caution in eating foods that can spoil from lack or proper refrigeration (such as salads containing mayonnaise, cream-filled pastries, heavy cream, and dairy products).</p>
