<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>Arrive Melbourne</h5>
<p>On arrival into Melbourne and after clearing customs, you will be met by a guide and transferred by private vehicle to your accommodation. Your room will have been pre-registered for immediate occupancy.</p>
<p>
Melbourne, the capital of the state of Victoria, is known as the Garden, Arts and Sports capital of Australia. It's beautiful tree-lined boulevards, many parks and gardens and beautiful Victorian terrace houses, great restaurants, wonderful theatre and art galleries together with international sporting events all combine to make this elegant city one of the world's most liveable.</p>
<p>
After some time to relax & refresh, meet your local guide in the hotel lobby for an afternoon walking tour that will introduce you to the hidden secrets of Melbourne. Join historian and raconteur Kenneth Park for a private look at elegant Melbourne. Experience the city's labyrinth of atmospheric arcades and alleyways - a wonderful way to learn Melbourne's architectural and cultural heritage. If you have a special interest Kenneth will tailor-make his walk just for you! (1.5hr walking tour).</p>
<p>
Park Hyatt Melbourne</p>
<p>
The Park Hyatt Melbourne is the city's most deluxe hotel. It is located at the 'top end' of Collins Street, directly opposite Melbourne's grandest cathedral and a few steps from Parliament House, the central business district and the beautiful Fitzroy Gardens.

<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Melbourne</h5>
<p>After breakfast this morning you will be met by your driver and transfer by private vehicle an hour & a half out of the city to rural Victoria. Today is a real treat - an exclusive experience - where you are welcomed into the home of the Barber family, to learn a little of what it is like to be an Aussie family 'living off the land'. This is a genuine operating sheep property which has been in the Barber Family name since 1917. The magnificent 6500 acre property is located approx 90 minutes from Melbourne. Meet Duncan Barber a 4th generation farmer of this land and enjoy an exclusive visit to his sheep farm.</p>
<p>
On arrival at the property you are treated to a delicious home-baked morning tea in the delightful surroundings of the Homestead, built in 1859. The history of the property and the passion the family have for it will become apparent as you enjoy your time getting to know your hosts Duncan, his wife Jess and Duncan's mother Rita.</p>
<p>
After morning tea, it is time for you to watch as Duncan shears a sheep. Within the confines of this historic woolshed built in 1944, you will learn more about the wool industry and the rich 150 year history which can be traced back to the Elector of Saxony. The finer details of preparing and classing a fleece and the process a fleece goes through will be detailed, and this beautiful product that ends up as fabric made into Italy's finest men's suits (Zegna) is sure to impress and enthrall. This is also a chance to watch Duncan work his Australian Sheep Dogs & to plant an Australian Native Tree to commemorate your visit to the property before returning to the homestead for a three course lunch with the Barber family. Your lunch will include Australian wine, beer and water.</p>
<p>
To conclude your day, Duncan will take you for a drive around the property to spot kangaroos in their natural environment before you re-join the vehicle and journey back to Melbourne. You will return to the city in the late afternoon with a sense of having broken through the tourist crust & seen the real Australia</p>
<p>
For dinner this evening we recommend a restaurant reservation at Gingerboy.</p>

<h5>Kangaroo Island - Alice Springs - Ayers Rock</h5>
<p>After breakfast this morning you will be transferred to Kingscote airport for your flight via Adelaide & Alice Springs to Ayers Rock. On arrival into Ayers Rock you will be met by your Longitude 131 representative & transferred to your accommodation.
</p>
<p>
The giant red monolith has come to represent Australia itself. The massive sandstone rock - the summit of a buried mountain - generates an almost mystical power. 'The Rock' is 8.8 kilometres around the base, 3.6 kilometres long, 2.4 kilometres wide and towers 348 metres above the surrounding plain. The Anangu people believe they are the direct descendents of the ancestral spirits who gave them the laws and rules that they live by. They believe they are responsible for the protection of the lands and ask visitors to respect their wishes not to climb the rock. Its significant power can be felt particularly in the early morning or at sunset as the Rock undergoes an extraordinary transformation of colour.</p>
<p>
After arriving at Longitude 131° and settling in, meet in the Dune House for a 3pm departure to the Cultural Centre where you will learn the cultural and spiritual meanings of Uluru & Kata Tjuta. Afterwards you will travel to Uluru, where we will take a short walk into Kantju Gorge. On arrival at the gorge we will serve refreshments 'inside' Uluru and watch the sunset. You will return to Longitude 131° at approximately 7.15pm.<br />
On your return, relax in the Dune House over pre-dinner drinks and canapés before enjoying a gourmet dinner with your fellow travellers or for a special occasion a private dinner by the pool or on the Dune Top.</p>
<p>
Longitude 131 The new 'safari' style luxury tented site is the first of its kind in Australia. Built on the very edge of Uluru Kata Tjuta National Park, the fifteen individual tents have uninterrupted views over Uluru. Relax in the free-form swimming pool and enjoy an aperitif on the balcony as the sunsets over the desert, or simply lie in bed and watch the stars rise over the outback. Inside the tent, the atmosphere is lavish with expansive stone floors, beautiful bed linen and unique bathrooms and air conditioning. This is a special place where you will connect with the desert landscape and its magnificent natural wonders. At the Dune House enjoy a quiet drink, good food and the company of newfound friends.</p>

<h4>Day 9</h4>
<h5>Mossman - Cape Tribulation - Mossman</h5>
<p>After breakfast this morning meet your guide in the hotel lobby for your full day 4WD exploration of the Daintree Rainforest & Cape Tribulation. You will travel through the rich farming areas toward the World Heritage Listed forest region of Cape Tribulation, where you step aboard a personalized craft for a cruise on the mirrored smooth waters of the Daintree River. You will cruise close to riverbanks and under the overhead canopy of the rainforest seeking out the vivid Ulysses Butterfly, Kingfishers and various other wildlife. The cruise takes you through silent backwaters where crocodiles can normally be seen basking on the muddy banks.</p>
<p>
Arriving on the northern side of the river you will then enter the Cape Tribulation section of the Wet Tropics World Heritage protected rainforest. The journey takes you up the beautiful Alexandra Range passing through rainforest waterfalls and on to the first stop for home-style morning tea deep in the rainforest at the Jindalba boardwalk. Jindalba (the aboriginal name for this place) is also where you literally immerse yourself inside the protected forests and go on a guided walk where you view plants of ancient linage right through to examples of more recent species of flowering plants.</p>
<p>
Continuing along the Cape Tribulation road, you then stop at the magical Thornton Beach. Here your guide will highlight the amazing wildlife and ecosystems unique to this part of the world - "where the rainforest meets the sea". You are often the only people on this stretch of wilderness beach and many who have travelled remark how they feel like Robinson Crusoe. This is also where Cooper Creek uniquely meets up with the Coral Sea.</p>
<p>
Lunch is a special treat today, deep under the Rainforest canopy. You will enjoy a delicious lunch of tropical rainforest-inspired local produce. You have the chance for a private rainforest walk here as well, and may possibly spot rainforest lizards, birds, butterflies and perhaps even marsupials! This is also your opportunity to immerse yourself in the fresh, clear, rainforest creek.</p>
<p>
A lasting impression will be at the outstanding panoramic picture postcard view at Alexandra Range Lookout. From here you'll have a spectacular view of the mouth of the Daintree River, Snapper Island and on a clear day right through to Port Douglas. One final treat for the day is the crossing on the Daintree River Ferry - the iconic vehicle punt which transfers you out of the world heritage rainforest and on to your home-ward road. You will be back at your accommodation early in the evening.</p>
<p>
Please note during wet season the itinerary may change due to higher water levels.</p>

Sydney, the capital of the state of New South Wales, is Australia's most well known city. With its extraordinary icons both natural and man-made this is a city that never fails to please the eye. It's magnificent natural harbour spanned by the 'coat hanger', the Sydney Harbour Bridge, and the man-made sails of the Sydney Opera House are just some of its most widely photographed views.</p>
<p>
Four Seasons Hotel Sydney is superbly situated right on Sydney Harbour in the city's historic Rocks area. The Four Seasons Sydney Hotel has wonderful views of the Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge. It is only a short walk from Sydney's major shopping and business districts.</p>

<h5>Sydney</h5>
<p>After breakfast this morning meet your guide in the hotel lobby for your morning sightseeing tour of the harbour city.</p>
<p>
Today's tour begins at Sydney's historic Rocks area known for its narrow cobbled streets and convict buildings. Continue past the historic Mint and Hyde Park Barracks and stop at Mrs Macquarie's Chair for wonderful views of the Harbour, Opera House and Harbour Bridge. From here journey on by private vehicle to the Sydney Opera House for a private, behind-the-scenes tour of this Australian icon.</p>
<p>
50 years ago a young Danish architect named Jorn Utzon dreaming of Bennelong Point, designed a masterpiece which pushed the boundaries of creativity and science - and put Sydney on the map forever. Step inside the world's most recognisable sails for a one hour tour and experience the miracle of architecture and engineering. A work of art that came into existence against impossible odds - to become one of the busiest performing arts centres in the world! Working with a new enriching interactive and audio visual component, where images are projected onto the fabric of the building - our guides will take you on an emotional journey, engrossing you in a story to rival any opera plot with its dramatic twists and turns.
You'll visit one of the major venues - where there are live performances every day. Some 1500 performances, in every genre you can imagine, are staged each year to audiences of around one million.</p>
<p>
From here your guide will escort you along Circular Quay to Campbell's Cove pontoon where your private charter vessel awaits.</p>
<p>
This afternoon you will be orientated with Sydney from the most enviable vantage point - on the water! Cruising on Sydney Harbour is a quintessential Australian experience, and today you will experience 'Calypso' - a 52 foot motor cruiser that is crewed & privately yours.</p>
 <p>
Whilst cruising this iconic harbour you will have the opportunity to swim, fish or kayak. However most choose to sit back with a glass of Australian beer or wine & take in the amazing sights - the Harbour Bridge, the Opera House, Luna Park, Fort Denison and the waterfront homes of the rich & famous. A barbeque lunch is served on board, while anchored in a secluded cove. And as the afternoon sun comes in we suggest making your way to the bow and settling in the sunbeds for the perfect views of the harbour city as you come back in to moor. Your 4 hour experience on the water ends at Campbell's Cove pontoon in the late afternoon, just a short walk from your hotel.</p>
<p>
For dinner this evening we recommend a restaurant reservation at Aria.</p>

Thought to mainly inhabit worldwide temperate and tropical seas, it is rarely seen in shallow coastal water, but is a daily visitor to the Ningaloo Reef between late March and July. Up to 12 Whale Sharks have been spotted close to the reef feeding (Whale Shark tours operate March - July).

The nearby Nairobi National Park boasts the presence of all but one of the`Big Five'. Shopping in Nairobi varies from African clothing and craft shops to open-air markets.

Visit the adjacent Maasai village, take a morning bush walk with an armed ranger or enjoy sundowners in the evening or even dinner under the stars in the middle of the African bush.<br /><br />In the Mara, the wildlife is abundant and the swaying grasslands ensure that animals are never out of sight. Elephants browse amongst the large herds of wildebeest, topi, gazelle, eland and buffalo. The plains offer a rich variety of food for the dominant predators: lion, leopard, hyena and cheetah. In the Mara River, hippos submerge while crocodiles sunbathe on the riverbanks.<br /><br />Around July to September, rain depending, the Masai Mara is host to the famous wildebeest migration which is one of the few remaining mass migrations of mammals in the world. During this time herds of over a million wildebeest will trawl their way through this region and they become the major focus for predatory activity and drama unfolds at every corner.<br /><br />There are also options for a morning balloon safari or a half-day visit to Lake Victoria.<br /><br />Balloon Safari: As the balloon is inflated against the first rays of sunrise your pilot will go through safety procedures. Once aloft, the balloon floats gently over the plains, giving a bird's eye view of the game below as the sun creeps slowly over the horizon. After around one hour the balloon lands as breakfast is already being prepared and, of course, enjoy a glass or two of bubbly to toast your flight in a tradition initiated by the Montgolfier brothers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lake Victoria Adventure : An early start this morning with a transfer to the airstrip for a flight by light aircraft to Lake Victoria. On arrival enjoy an appetising full English breakfast before you board the boat for the morning. There will be the opportunity to try fishing for the legendary giant Nile perch found in these waters as you explore the myriad of tiny islands in this region of the lake. An experienced and knowledgeable fisherman captains each boat.
