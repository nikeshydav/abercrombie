the dark pit of Zindan, the prison, where two British officers were kept before being executed in the main square in June 1842. Opposite the Ark
is the elegant and fragile looking Bolo-Khauz Mosque, beautifully reflected in the pool in front of it.</p>
<p>In the centre of the old town is the Lyabi-Khauz Ensemble with the elegant buildings standing around the pool. Among them are: the Kukeldash
Madrassah (the 16th century), the Nodyr-Divan-Beghi Madrassah and Khanako (the 17th century). The buildings’ reflection in the pool and the
ancient trees around it create a special atmosphere of peace and solitude. Beyond the greenery of the park one can see the beautiful brick
lacework of the Ismail Samani Mausoleum (the 9th – 10th centuries) done in the style that predates the use of the glazed tiles. One can still drink
from the Prophet Job’s Well around which a Shrine was built in the 14th century.</p>
<p>Continue your exploration of the area and drive to the eastern suburbs of Bukhara to visit the Sitora-i-Mokhi-Khosa, the Summer Palace of the
last Emir, built in an intriguingly eclectic style, combining European and local elements. Its breathtaking Reception Hall decorated in carved
stucco and mirrors has become a model for the modern craftsmen of Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>Also visit the Boghoudin Nakshbandi Complex before proceeding to the Silk Road Tea house.</p>
<p>Enjoy lunch and dinner at a city restaurant.</p>

<p><strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B, L, D</p>
</li>

<li>
<h4>Day 10</h4>
<h5>Bukhara - Samarkand</h5>
<p>After breakfast drive to Samarkand (280 km, 4 hours). Arrive in time to check-in at your hotel and enjoy lunch at a city restaurant.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, follow your guide on an orientation tour of Samarkand – one of the world’s oldest cities, located in the very centre of Uzbekistan
in the valley of the Zeravshan River. It has seen periods of power and decline throughout its 2750-year history. The city was destroyed by
Alexander the Great, the Arabs, Genghis Khan and many other conquerors, but rose each time from the ashes like a Phoenix.</p>
<p>Samarkand was a capital of ancient Sogdiana, part of the huge Akhemenian Empire in the 4th century BC. In the 14th century when Tamerlane
made it his capital, Samarkand became one of the most powerful and desired cities in the world.</p>
<p>One can sense the old grandeur of the city glimpsing a view of Bibi Khanym Mosque (the 15th century) on the Northern side of the city, the
largest structure of its time in the world, standing beside a noisy and crowded oriental market full of colorful fruits, vegetables and fragrant spices
grown on Uzbek land. Visiting the harmonious Registan Square one can fully agree with Lord George Curzon – the Viceroy of India, who said:
“Registan in Samarkand is the best central city square in the world”.</p>
<p>Shah-i-Zinda, a big medieval burial complex (the 10th – to 20th centuries), often referred to as “the Street of the Dead”, gives a good idea of
Tamerlane’s intention to turn Samarkand into a collection of the world’s architectural styles.</p>

<p><strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B, L, D</p>
</li>

<li>
<h4>Day 11</h4>
<h5>Full day - Samarkand</h5>
<p>Today continue to explore Samarkand.</p>
<p>The The Gur-Emir Mausoleum (the 15th century), where Tamerlane is buried along with several sons and grandsons, is the most brilliant
example of medieval Central Asian architecture. It is reminiscent of the famous mosques of Cordova and Granada and was an inspiration for the
Great Moguls’ Taj Mahal in Agra.</p>
<p>Samarkand was also an important scientific centre, with scholars who influenced scientific work in other countries. Among them was Ulugbek,
Tamerlane’s grandson, the ruler of Samarkand. His observatory, built in 1429 – 30 in the northern suburbs of Samarkand, was a model for the
two famous Indian observatories of the 18th century in Jaipur and Delhi. The observatory has not survived, but an underground portion of its
enormous sextant still attracts the eye.</p>
<p>Finish your day with a visit to the “Khudjum” silk carpet factory.</p>

<p><strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B, L, D</p>
</li>

<li>
<h4>Day 12</h4>
<h5>Samarkand - Tashkent</h5>
<p>After breakfast drive to Tashkent (295 km, 4 hours) and check-in upon arrival.</p>
<p>After lunch in a local restaurant, explore Tashkent, the modern capital of the Republic of Uzbekistan. The city’s history spans over 2 millennia,
although few monuments from ancient times have survived here. Wars and natural calamities have swept most of the old buildings from the face
of the ancient city. Among the survivors are: the Kukeldash Madrassah (the 16th century), the Yunus Khan Mausoleum (the 15th century), the
Sheikhantaur Ensemble (the 15th century).</p>
<p>This afternoon you will also have the chance to experience a calligraphy master class.</p>

Mosque (19th cent), the Dahmai – Sharon Mausoleum (14 – 15th cent.) and the Hudoyar Jhan Palace (17 – 19th cent.).</p>

Enjoy a full day exploring the Serengeti by 4WD vehicle with thrilling morning and afternoon game drives. Whether this is your first time on safari or a return trip the Serengeti will not disappoint.<br /><br />The Serengeti National Park is arguably the most famous national park in the world. The Serengeti perhaps defines the safari experience as surely as the wildlife that inhabits it. Established in 1951, and covering an area of almost 15,000 sq km, an area comparable to the state of Connecticut or Northern Ireland, the Serengeti hosts a fantastically diverse ecosystem. The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, where 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other plains game that follow close behind, make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";

The name comes from the Maasai meaning "endless plains". The Serengeti contains about three million large animals, most taking part in seasonal migrations, unparalleled in nature. Be sure to have your camera constantly at hand as life in the Serengeti is always action packed.<br /></p>";

Fly from Dar es Salaam to the remote Selous Game Reserve. Upon arrival you are met by a camp representative and transferred to your camp to settle in. This afternoon explore the Selous either by foot on a walking safari, by boat on the Rufiji and Lake Tagala, or in open 4WD vehicles. All excursions are escorted by an experienced armed guide.<br /><br />Selous Sand Rivers is situated on the banks of the Rufiji River, offering a unique combination of adventure, comfort and exclusivity. This small luxury lodge, crafted out of local materials, comprises six individually designed cottages with en-suite bathrooms. Spaced along the river bank, each has its own private view of the wide sand-banked river with its hippos, crocodiles and birdlife. Near the dining area a large baobab tree shades the swimming pool in which guests can escape the heat of the sun or cool off after a game walk.<br /></p>";

Enjoy the solitude whilst observing elephants, lions, buffalo, hippos and crocodiles. Game drives are conducted by 4WD vehicles or from your river boat, the more adventurous of you may like to stretch your legs with a walking safari.<br /><br />The Selous Game Reserve is the largest game reserve in the world and has some of the finest virgin bush left in Africa, where the last of the really big-tusked elephants and large-maned lions roam. The Selous supports around one million game animals, is bigger than Switzerland and is a World Heritage site. From March to May floods sweep the valley, forcing the game on to the 'islands' of higher ground, where elephant, buffalo, lion, leopard, crocodile, puku, buck, eland, sable and others concentrate.<br /></p>";

Transfer from Arusha to Ngorongoro Crater Lodge located on the rim with spectacular views across the crater. The Ngorongoro Crater is the largest unbroken caldera in the world and the first sight of it is breathtaking.<br /><br />Ngorongoro Crater Lodge is situated on the edge of the ancient crater rim above the cool, swirling mists. The lodge is a return to the noble elegance of the travelling colonials. Inspired in design by the Maasai Manyatta, three separate camps of 6 to 12 suites each remember a bygone era when characters such as Lord Delamere adorned the stilted, handcrafted structures with graceful antiques, grand chandeliers and treasures collected from travels through Africa.<br /><br /></p>";

Enjoy a picnic lunch amongst the hippos and birds before visiting a Maasai village this afternoon.<br /><br />The floor of the crater is only 100 sq miles but is home to around 30,000 animals with a high concentration of predators and some of the finest black-maned lions in Africa. Rhinos can often be seen with calves at heel. Eland and waterbuck appear not to notice the human visitors, enabling photographers to shoot at ease. On the lake in the middle of the crater you may see thousands of flamingos fluttering and shimmering like a pink heat haze. Zebra and wildebeest account for almost half the animals. Gazelle, buffalo, eland, hartebeest and wart hog can also be seen.<br /></p>";

The camp offers spectacular views across Tortillis woodland situated on the edge of the short grass plains. The camp is comprised of nine double tents scattered around the kopje with the mess tent and common area as the central feature.
