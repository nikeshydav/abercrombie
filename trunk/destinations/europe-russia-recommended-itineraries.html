<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 6 days</p>
<p>Experience New Year somewhere different with this 6-day itinerary showcasing St Petersburg's highlights and the spectacular New Year Tsar's
Ball.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong>St Petersburg, Hermitage, Yusupov Palace, Pavlovsk Palace, Troika Ride, Tsar's New Year Ball at Catherine Palace, tea with a
local Russian family, Russian Museum, Mariinsky Theatre backstage tour.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>Arrive St Petersburg - 29th December</h5>
<p>Upon arrival at St Petersburg airport you will be met in the arrivals hall by your guide and privately transferred to your luxurious hotel in the city
centre where your Guardian Angel will assist you with check-in.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Grand Hotel Europe</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>St Petersburg: Hermitage with Gold Room, Yusupov Palace - 30th December</h5>
<p>The Hermitage museum is situated in the lavishly decorated Winter Palace and occupies six magnificent buildings with three million pieces of
artwork from the Stone Age to modern times. The main building and largest part of the museum is the rococo-style Winter Palace, residence of
the Czars from 1762 to 1917. The museum was commissioned by Catherine the Great and she and her successors built the Hermitage collection
in large part with purchases of private collections of the Western European aristocracy and monarchies. Visit the museum with your private guide
and also pay a special visit to the Gold Room and its exquisite collection of Scythian gold.</p>
<p>Enjoy lunch at leisure before visiting the opulent Yusupov Palace nearby, home to Russia’s wealthiest family before the revolution. As well as
visiting the beautiful state and private rooms (including the exotic Moorish Room) we will also visit the basement room where the ‘mad monk’
Rasputin was poisoned in 1916.</p>
<p>This evening you may wish to have dinner at one of the city’s finest restaurants. Your Guardian Angel will provide a list of recommended
restaurants and help you with the table reservation.</p>
<p>One of our preferred restaurants is the “Tsar”, located in a building with rich historical background, on Sadovaya St. 12. The eatery offers its
guests delicacies of Russian State royal cuisine. Looking at the menu, guests will be transported to the 19th-20th centuries, when some amazing
and unique dishes were considered standard cuisine for the daily Royal table.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Grand Hotel Europe <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>    
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>St Petersburg: Pavlovsk Palace with Troika horse ride, Tsar's Ball at Catherine Palace - 31st December</h5>
<p>Travel south out of St. Petersburg for a morning visit to Pavlosk Palace which remained a royal residence until 1917. Pavlosk’s park of
woodland, rivers, lakes, and classical statues is one of the most exquisite in Russia and the Great Palace is a classical contrast to Catherine’s
Palace. After a visit of the interior, you will enjoy a ride in a horse drawn troika, three horses will pull you along on a big carriage, colorfully
painted in a traditional Russian style. The fervent ring of the bells tied to a bridle will be your accompanying music.</p>
<p>Afterwards enjoy lunch at the lively country restaurant Podvorie Dacha, where President Putin has celebrated his birthday. Return to St.
Petersburg with time to prepare for the evening ahead.</p>
<p>This evening depart your hotel for unforgettable night at the Tsar’s Ball at Catherine Palace.</p>
<p>The ball has been successfully organized annually since 1994 and takes place in the magnificent Catherine Palace in Tsarskoye Selo on the 31st
of December. The palace hosts the Ball with the authentic atmosphere of unequaled pomp. Guests will experience an evening of true romance
and splendor echoing the imperial traditions of a bygone era.</p>
<p>On arrival at Catherine Palace, enjoy a welcome by the Military Brass Orchestra while Royal Hussars with torches escort you to the building.
Upon entering the Palace guests are invited to sip a cocktail on the Grand Staircase before making their way through the beautiful baroque
rooms to the Throne Hall for dinner. The fabulous 5 course dinner is accompaniment by a Symphony Orchestra, Classical Balalaika Orchestra
as well as ballet and opera performances and is followed by a bell concert and fireworks display in the park as the clock strikes twelve. After
midnight a Russian folklore show, Cossack show and String and Jazz Orchestras will play into the early hours making for a truly special and
greatly memorable New Year celebration.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Grand Hotel Europe <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>    
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>

<p>Khiva – a museum in the open – is the only city in all of Central Asia that has survived in its entirety from the old times. Various historic epochs
have left their traces in Khiva, built over many centuries in the ancient cultural oasis of Khorasmia. Old Khiva is an entire city, constructed within
magnificent fortification walls with entrance gates. Its unique architectural complexes that include palaces, houses, public buildings and
mausolea, interspersed with original architecture such as the minarets of Islam-Khodja, Kalta-Minar and Tura-Murad-Tura, are a bright illustration
of the Muslim tradition, according to which buildings raised at different times constitute an ensemble. A number of Madrassahs from the 18th and
19th centuries reflect not only the skills of architects and builders but also the fact that Khiva was an important educational center.</p>
<p>Visit the National House of Zaynab’s Family for a traditional tea ceremony.</p>

<p>Enjoy dinner at your hotel.</p>
<p><strong>Meal Plan:</strong>B, L, D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 9</h4>
<h5>Full day - Bukhara</h5>
<p>Today spend a full day in Bukhara to experience its very special atmosphere.</p>
<p>The massive walls of the Ark Fortress dominate the old town area. Behind them are the elegant eiwans of the mosques and divans. There is also
the dark pit of Zindan, the prison, where two British officers were kept before being executed in the main square in June 1842. Opposite the Ark
is the elegant and fragile looking Bolo-Khauz Mosque, beautifully reflected in the pool in front of it.</p>
<p>In the centre of the old town is the Lyabi-Khauz Ensemble with the elegant buildings standing around the pool. Among them are: the Kukeldash
Madrassah (the 16th century), the Nodyr-Divan-Beghi Madrassah and Khanako (the 17th century). The buildings’ reflection in the pool and the
ancient trees around it create a special atmosphere of peace and solitude. Beyond the greenery of the park one can see the beautiful brick
lacework of the Ismail Samani Mausoleum (the 9th – 10th centuries) done in the style that predates the use of the glazed tiles. One can still drink
from the Prophet Job’s Well around which a Shrine was built in the 14th century.</p>
<p>Continue your exploration of the area and drive to the eastern suburbs of Bukhara to visit the Sitora-i-Mokhi-Khosa, the Summer Palace of the
last Emir, built in an intriguingly eclectic style, combining European and local elements. Its breathtaking Reception Hall decorated in carved
stucco and mirrors has become a model for the modern craftsmen of Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>Also visit the Boghoudin Nakshbandi Complex before proceeding to the Silk Road Tea house.</p>
<p>Enjoy lunch and dinner at a city restaurant.</p>

<p><strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B, L, D</p>
</li>

<li>
<h4>Day 10</h4>
<h5>Bukhara - Samarkand</h5>
<p>After breakfast drive to Samarkand (280 km, 4 hours). Arrive in time to check-in at your hotel and enjoy lunch at a city restaurant.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, follow your guide on an orientation tour of Samarkand – one of the world’s oldest cities, located in the very centre of Uzbekistan
in the valley of the Zeravshan River. It has seen periods of power and decline throughout its 2750-year history. The city was destroyed by
Alexander the Great, the Arabs, Genghis Khan and many other conquerors, but rose each time from the ashes like a Phoenix.</p>
<p>Samarkand was a capital of ancient Sogdiana, part of the huge Akhemenian Empire in the 4th century BC. In the 14th century when Tamerlane
made it his capital, Samarkand became one of the most powerful and desired cities in the world.</p>
<p>One can sense the old grandeur of the city glimpsing a view of Bibi Khanym Mosque (the 15th century) on the Northern side of the city, the
largest structure of its time in the world, standing beside a noisy and crowded oriental market full of colorful fruits, vegetables and fragrant spices
grown on Uzbek land. Visiting the harmonious Registan Square one can fully agree with Lord George Curzon – the Viceroy of India, who said:
“Registan in Samarkand is the best central city square in the world”.</p>
<p>Shah-i-Zinda, a big medieval burial complex (the 10th – to 20th centuries), often referred to as “the Street of the Dead”, gives a good idea of
Tamerlane’s intention to turn Samarkand into a collection of the world’s architectural styles.</p>

<p><strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B, L, D</p>
</li>

<li>
<h4>Day 11</h4>
<h5>Full day - Samarkand</h5>
<p>Today continue to explore Samarkand.</p>
<p>The The Gur-Emir Mausoleum (the 15th century), where Tamerlane is buried along with several sons and grandsons, is the most brilliant
example of medieval Central Asian architecture. It is reminiscent of the famous mosques of Cordova and Granada and was an inspiration for the
Great Moguls’ Taj Mahal in Agra.</p>
<p>Samarkand was also an important scientific centre, with scholars who influenced scientific work in other countries. Among them was Ulugbek,
Tamerlane’s grandson, the ruler of Samarkand. His observatory, built in 1429 – 30 in the northern suburbs of Samarkand, was a model for the
two famous Indian observatories of the 18th century in Jaipur and Delhi. The observatory has not survived, but an underground portion of its
enormous sextant still attracts the eye.</p>
<p>Finish your day with a visit to the “Khudjum” silk carpet factory.</p>

<p><strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B, L, D</p>
</li>

<li>
<h4>Day 12</h4>
<h5>Samarkand - Tashkent</h5>
<p>After breakfast drive to Tashkent (295 km, 4 hours) and check-in upon arrival.</p>
<p>After lunch in a local restaurant, explore Tashkent, the modern capital of the Republic of Uzbekistan. The city’s history spans over 2 millennia,
although few monuments from ancient times have survived here. Wars and natural calamities have swept most of the old buildings from the face
of the ancient city. Among the survivors are: the Kukeldash Madrassah (the 16th century), the Yunus Khan Mausoleum (the 15th century), the
Sheikhantaur Ensemble (the 15th century).</p>
<p>This afternoon you will also have the chance to experience a calligraphy master class.</p>
<p><strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B, L, D</p>
</li>
    
<li>
<h4>Day 13</h4>
<h5>Tashkent - Namangan</h5>
<p>Fly to Namangan this morning and transfer to Fergana via Margilan (110 km, 1,5 hour).</p>
<p>After check-in at your hotel, follow your guide on a sightseeing tour including General Skobolev’s House, the Russian Army Assembly Hall, the
Park and the History Museum.</p>
<p>Lunch and dinner will be in a city restaurant or your hotel in Fergana.</p>
<p><strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B, L, D</p>
</li>

<li>
<h4>Day 14</h4>
<h5>Fergana</h5>
<p>After breakfast in the hotel, travel to Rishtan for a city tour with a visit to the Rishtan ceramics centre.</p>
<p>Afterwards drive to Kokand – an ancient city of the Silk Way, where you may see the Madrassah of Norbut – Bii (the 18th cent.), the Djuma
Mosque (19th cent), the Dahmai – Sharon Mausoleum (14 – 15th cent.) and the Hudoyar Jhan Palace (17 – 19th cent.).</p>

<p><strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>Moscow</h5>
<p>This morning you are taken on a visit to the Kremlin grounds, the very place from where the city itself arose one day. For centuries, the Kremlin
has been witness to many famous and tragic events in Russia’s past and has become a treasure trove of Russian history. Visit two of the
Kremlin’s cathedrals: Assumption, the place of coronations and the burial church of religious leaders, and Archangel, the royal burial church.</p>
<p>The tour will continue with a visit to the State Armoury, the oldest museum in Russia and home to a collection of precious stones, masterpieces
of 18th and 19th century jewellery and priceless artefacts dating as far back as the 14th century, as well as an impressive collection of carriages

<p>You may want to conclude your day with a performance at the recently refurbished, famous Bolshoi theatre. The grand theatre in Moscow stands

<p><strong>Meal Plan: </strong>B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>

<p>Today you will enjoy a full day's sightseeing with your guide and private vehicle. On a drive through the historical city centre, you will see the
main city sights; Nevsky Prospect, Palace Square, the Winter Palace, the Admiralty and Vasilevsky Island. Visit the fascinating Peter & Paul
Fortress, which Peter the Great built in 1703 to provide protection from the Swedes. The Fortress Cathedral is the burial place of most of
Russia's Tsars and Tsarinas from the 18th century onwards, including Peter the Great himself, the great architect of St Petersburg. Afterwards Russia's Tsars and Tsarinas from the 18th century onwards, including Peter the Great himself, the great architect of St Petersburg. Afterwards
visit St. Isaac's Cathedral, whose gilded dome dominates the skyline of St. Petersburg. The cathedral's construction began in 1818 and was not
completed until 1858. Sculptures and massive red granite columns ornament the façade, while the interior is even more lavishly decorated with
mosaics, icons and columns of malachite and lapis lazuli.</p>
<p>If you wish to get to know Russians better this is the very visit for you. Yuri Petrochenko and his wife Neli live in a flat at the 18th century mention.
Their house is a small museum where you can see old portraits, icons, antique furniture and numerous pieces of Russian Art. Uryi himself is a
great Russian artist famous abroad for his painting on ceramics, and especially his collection of ceramic painted Eggs. Neli will cook a delicious
Russian pasty and tell many interesting stories about this intriguing country and its people.<br>
Later this afternoon, experience a unique perspective of St. Petersburg with a one-hour private journey on a canal boat which allows you to see
unusual parts of the city not seen when driving along the city streets. The city is built on 42 islands, being washed by more than 90 rivers: Neva’s
arms and channels. The granite embankments with slopes and piers have become peculiar pedestals for the magnificent palaces.</p>
<p><strong>Meal Plan: </strong>B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>St Petersburg</h5>
<p>Your driver and guide will take you to visit one of the most famous museums in the world, the awe-inspiring Hermitage in the lavishly decorated
Winter Palace.</p>
<p>The Hermitage occupies six magnificent buildings and houses 3 million pieces of artwork from the Stone Age to modern times. The main building
and largest part of the museum is the rococo-style Winter Palace, residence of the Czars from 1762 to 1917. The museum was commissioned by
Catherine the Great and she and her successors built the Hermitage collection in large part with purchases of the private collections of the
Western European aristocracy and monarchy. By the time Nicholas II ascended the throne in 1894, he was heir to the greatest collection of art in
Europe. The whole museum complex was bombarded during the siege of Leningrad in WWII but re-opened to the public in 1945.</p>
<p>One exhibition of note is the heroes of 1812 gallery displaying portraits of kings, military leaders and diplomats.</p>
<p>Following lunch at leisure let your artistic abilities and imagination run free while either painting your own traditional matryoshka doll at the
matryoshka painting master class or learning to dance traditional folk dance such as Khorovods or Kadrils</p>
<p><strong>Meal Plan: </strong>B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 8</h4>
<h5>Pushkin - Pavlovsk</h5>
<p>Today travel with your private vehicle and guide outside the city to visit Tsarskoe Selo (renamed Pushkin in 1937 to commemorate the centenary
of famous Russian poet’s death). You may visit the summer palace, created for Catherine I, expanded and redesigned for Empress Elizabeth
and remodeled again for Catherine the Great. The baroque Catherine Palace, whose exterior features golden domes and blue and white facade
mouldings, suffered extensive wartime damage, but is today a masterpiece of restoration thanks to the reinstatement of the world-famous amber
room enhancing the interior that gleams and glitters with mirrors, chandeliers and gilded woodcarvings.</p>
<p>Afterwards Enjoy a traditional hearty Russian lunch at Podvorie Dacha which resembles a Russian terem (wooden palace): pickles, cold cuts,
salads, borsch, and pancakes with ice cream). The restaurant is housed in a typical Russian log house and its interior is filled with wooden
panels and bear skins hanging on the walls of the restaurant. The restaurant offers a relaxed, informal atmosphere. This restaurant in recent
years has hosted President Putin’s birthday celebrations and is also renowned for its excellent and lively folklore performances.</p>
<p>Travel to Pavlovsk and have a unique chance to participate in an Old Russian entertainment – riding on a Russian Troika. Three horses will take
you for a ride on a big carriage painted in traditionally Russian style. The fervent ring of the bells tied to a bridle will be your accompanying music.</p>
<p><strong>Meal Plan: </strong>B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 9</h4>
<h5>Petrodvorets - St Petersburg</h5>
<p>Today travel with your private vehicle and guide outside the city to Petrodvorets (also known as Peterhof), the great summer estate and artistic
gem of Peter the Great, nestled on the shore of the Gulf of Finland (part of the Baltic Sea). After his victory over the Swedes at Poltava in 1709,
Peter decided to build a palace “befitting to the very highest of monarchs” and a visit to Versailles in 1717 furthered these ambitions. This
magnificent estate was officially opened in 1723. A prominent highlight is the Grand Cascade, a delightful sequence of 37 gilded bronze
sculptures, 64 fountains and 142 water jets descending from the terraces of the Great Palace to the Marine Canal and the sea. The park
features numerous palaces, summer houses and pavilions.</p>
<p>Take hydrofoil to travel back to the city.</p>
<p>After lunch at leisure a private backstage tour of the Mariinsky theatre will be provided for you. One of the city’s attractions is the Imperial Opera
Theatre called Mariinsky in honour of Maria Fedorovna, the wife of Emperor Alexander II. Built by architect Cavos in 1859-1860, it was
inaugurated in 1860. Today the Mariinsky Theatre is one of the most beautiful in the world, famous for its renowned performers such as Marius
Petipa, Matilda Kshesinskaya, Anna Pavlova, Rudolf Nyreev, Michael Barishnikov, Fyodor Shalyapin and others. The theatre has witnessed the
triumphs of several generations of opera and ballet stars. You will visit usually unseen areas of the theatre including backstage, wardrobe and
the roof where the decorations are made before being transferred back to your hotel.</p>
<p><strong>Meal Plan: </strong>B</p>

During this time herds of over a million wildebeest will trawl their way through this region and they become the major focus for predatory activity and drama unfolds at every corner.<br /><br />There are also options for a morning balloon safari or a half-day visit to Lake Victoria.<br /><br />Balloon Safari: As the balloon is inflated against the first rays of sunrise your pilot will go through safety procedures. Once aloft, the balloon floats gently over the plains, giving a bird's eye view of the game below as the sun creeps slowly over the horizon. After around one hour the balloon lands as breakfast is already being prepared and, of course, enjoy a glass or two of bubbly to toast your flight in a tradition initiated by the Montgolfier brothers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lake Victoria Adventure : An early start this morning with a transfer to the airstrip for a flight by light aircraft to Lake Victoria. On arrival enjoy an appetising full English breakfast before you board the boat for the morning. There will be the opportunity to try fishing for the legendary giant Nile perch found in these waters as you explore the myriad of tiny islands in this region of the lake.

Game drives are conducted by 4WD vehicles or from your river boat, the more adventurous of you may like to stretch your legs with a walking safari.<br /><br />The Selous Game Reserve is the largest game reserve in the world and has some of the finest virgin bush left in Africa, where the last of the really big-tusked elephants and large-maned lions roam. The Selous supports around one million game animals, is bigger than Switzerland and is a World Heritage site. From March to May floods sweep the valley, forcing the game on to the 'islands' of higher ground, where elephant, buffalo, lion, leopard, crocodile, puku, buck, eland, sable and others concentrate.<br /></p>";

Alternatively you may like to relax at your camp with a book on your private verandah or cool off in the camp's pool.<br /><br />The Selous is Africa's largest wildlife sanctuary and one of its least known treasures. Covering 21,000 square miles of completely undeveloped land, the Selous is one of the last great tracts of true wilderness left in Africa.<br /></p>";

Upon arrival at Arusha airport you will be met by your private driver/guide who will escort you for the duration of your safari in Tanzania. Transfer from Arusha to Ngorongoro Crater Lodge located on the rim with spectacular views across the crater. The Ngorongoro Crater is the largest unbroken caldera in the world and the first sight of it is breathtaking.<br /><br />Ngorongoro Crater Lodge is situated on the edge of the ancient crater rim above the cool, swirling mists. The lodge is a return to the noble elegance of the travelling colonials. Inspired in design by the Maasai Manyatta, three separate camps of 6 to 12 suites each remember a bygone era when characters such as Lord Delamere adorned the stilted, handcrafted structures with graceful antiques, grand chandeliers and treasures collected from travels through Africa.<br /><br /></p>";

Spot some of the rarer species in Africa like the black rhino against the spectacular backdrop of the crater's forest covered walls. Enjoy a picnic lunch amongst the hippos and birds before visiting a Maasai village this afternoon.<br /><br />The floor of the crater is only 100 sq miles but is home to around 30,000 animals with a high concentration of predators and some of the finest black-maned lions in Africa. Rhinos can often be seen with calves at heel. Eland and waterbuck appear not to notice the human visitors, enabling photographers to shoot at ease. On the lake in the middle of the crater you may see thousands of flamingos fluttering and shimmering like a pink heat haze. Zebra and wildebeest account for almost half the animals. Gazelle, buffalo, eland, hartebeest and wart hog can also be seen.<br /></p>";

The camp offers spectacular views across Tortillis woodland situated on the edge of the short grass plains. The camp is comprised of nine double tents scattered around the kopje with the mess tent and common area as the central feature. Privacy between tents is guaranteed as they are at a substantial distance from each other and are generally concealed by a tree or kopje.<br /></p>";
