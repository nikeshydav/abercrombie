<dt><h2>Amman</h2> 
<p>Jordan's capital city Amman is just a five hour drive from anywhere in the country. Acting as a convenient base for any tour, there is a wide variety in restaurants, hotels, shops and galleries. Sightseeing in Jordan can start from the ancient Citadel which is located high above the city while viewing other tourist attractions like the regal columns of a Roman temple, the elegant capitals of a Byzantine church, the Umayyad Palace with its exquisite carvings and the Archaeological Museum from where you can trace back the history of this country.</p>
<div class="thepet"><p>At the Citadel, travel to its foot and observe the city from a seat in the Roman Theatre (a deep-sided bowl shaped structure into the hill) which is till date used for several cultural events. Also take a ride in the Hijaz Railway which was repeatedly sabotaged by the troops of Sherif Faisal and Lawrence of Arabia with the purpose of defeating the Ottomans. Try the coffeehouses, the local sugs or markets, the delicacy of mezzeh (appetisers) or go in for traditional Jordanian cuisine here.</p>

<dt><h2>Jerash</h2> 
<p>Famous by its annual Jerash Festival held every summer where international performers of music and dance groups come together, this city lies in the biblical land of Gilead in a fertile valley. Located to the north of Amman it flourished to great heights during the first century AD when it housed at least 25,000 people. This was the time when a number of temples were continuously built adorning the land of the city. Home to three large amphitheatres, the South Theatre is the biggest where the festivals are held.</p>
<div class="thepet"><p>During 330 AD, Emperor Constantine announced Christianity as the new religion of the Roman Empire's eastern half and the city of Jerash fell into the Byzantine segment. Construction started over time with some temples being transformed into churches while new ones being built. These had mosaic flooring just like at Madaba. The old streets of Jerash still show signs of chariot wheels and colonnaded streets, preserving all that was lost with time. </p>

<dt><h2>Ajloun</h2> 
<p>Lying in the north of Jordan, the city of Ajloun is home to the famously beautiful Ajlan Castle or Qalat er-Rabad as it is known in Arabic. Overlooking the city from a high platform, this fortress was built between the time of 1184 and 1185 by one of Salah-Eddin's (Saladin) nephews in order to protect the country against crusaders who were building castles in Kerak and Shobak.</p>
<div class="thepet"><p>She was also built to control the iron mines at Ajloun. Mameluks later made additions to the building and enlarged it before the Mongols conquered it in 1260, after which many more additions have been made. To protect the castle, a deep ditch cut was made in the rock surrounding it. The drawbridge today has been replaced by an iron footbridge for easy access to the fortress. </p>

<dt><h2>The Dead Sea</h2> 
<p>Dead Sea has for centuries marvelled its visitors with the eclectic mix of high annual temperatures, low humidity and high atmospheric pressures which lends its air the extremely oxygenated tag. Since the days of Herod the Great, travellers have come here to explore and understand the secrets of this place. This place has a high content of minerals and salts in the world which lends the Sea its anti-inflammatory properties. Dead Sea has a certain dark mud found on its shores which has been in use for over 2000 years for therapeutic purposes. </p>
<div class="thepet"><p>There have been excavations at Bethany which show that a first century settlement with plastered pools and water systems most certainly used for mass baptisms exists. There is a fifth to seventh century Byzantine settlement with churches, monastery and other religious structures that served as a pilgrimage site has been found. Survey proves that it served as a crucial ancient and sacred pilgrimage route that linked holy places of Jerusalem, Jordan River and Mount Nebo. John the Baptist started his mission in Jordan and at Bethany he baptised Jesus. He was arrested here by Herod Antipus and was imprisoned in the fortress of Machareus (modern Mukawir) before he got beheaded on the request of Salome, Herod Antipas' stepdaughter.

<dt><h2>Madaba</h2> 
<p>Madaba is known as the 'city of mosaics' as it sits prettily on an archaeological site which is rich in history of more than 4000 years. The mosaics found here of Byzantine and Umayyad variety has listed Madaba as one of the very important and prominent cities with respect to mosaics. </p>
<div class="thepet"><p>There is a St.George's Church here which has the world-famous mosaic floor depicting a map of Palestine and the Nile Delta. At its centre is a detailed map of Jerusalem as it was shaped during the sixth century AD.</p>

<dt><h2>Mount Nebo</h2> 
<p>This is the place from where Moses was allowed to see the Holy Land but never enter it. Holding a special spiritual relevance, Mount Nebo is a memorial site which has the 'Church of Moses' built by the first Christians. This mountain has for a long time been a holy place and a destination for pilgrimage.</p>
<div class="thepet"><p>From here you can have a great view of Jordan, the Dead Sea and Israel. You can even see Jerusalem when the weather is clear as it is just 60 kilometres away. Try late evening or early morning for a clear view.</p>

<dt><h2>Kerak</h2> 
<p>Lying 140 kilometres south of Amman, Kerak was chosen as the best point for their stronghold by Crusaders. A Crusader Castle, Kerak is situated midway between Jerusalem and Shobak at a hilltop 1,000 metres above the sea level, surrounded on three sides by a Valley. Constructions began in 1142, when Salah-Eddin conquered it in 1189 and re-built it. </p>
<div class="thepet"><p>It gets its added-on protection from the natural steep terrain which covers the north and south sides while a ditch surrounding the castle provides an additional layer of security. Mighty and huge this castle has everything that will attract visitors to the Jordanian land. It has never been inhabited by a court but has been used as a defensive stronghold, something that is clearly visible even from the outer look of Kerak.</p></div>

<dt><h2>Petra</h2> 
<p>Petro is a well-known World Heritage Site which has more than 800 historical monuments to its credit. Built from 800 BC to 100 AD by Nabetean Arabs, it is called 'the red rose city half as old as time'. It covers a land area of more than 100 sq kilometres and was a fortress in that era, built out of craggy rocks. Petra gained a heightened fame during the rule of Romans in the first and second centuries.</p>
<div class="thepet"><p>Its importance denigrated when the caravan routes were replaced with shipping. The city got its second life when the Swiss explorer Johan Ludwig Burckhardt re-discovered Petra after 1812. Today, Petra is the biggest tourist attraction while Kheznah (the treasury) starred in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade blockbusters.</p>

<dt><h2>Wadi Rum</h2> 
<p>Wadi Rum is worldwide known for its supernatural atmosphere and mystical elements which give it the name 'Valley of the Moon'. Its landscape forms a colourful and awe-inspiring pattern of shapes which served as the setting for the film Lawrence of Arabia and this is where T.E. Lawrence actually set his camp. </p>
<div class="thepet"><p> His book 'The Seven Pillars of Wisdom' gets its name from the seven natural columns which vary in height and lie enroute to Wadi Rum. The city has a number of Bedouin camps and thus travellers can taste the hospitality and generosity of a Bedouin family in Wadi Rum. Explore the desert with the help of a local Bedouin guide or stay in a Bedouin tent in the middle of the desert.</p>

<p>Aqaba is what a modern port of Jordan is called. It has been built over many ancient sites and thus has a special historical importance. On excavations a Chalcholithic site Tell Maquss was found, after which many discoveries have been made of long-lost ancient sites. </p>
<div class="thepet"><p>Out on the sea front it is supposed to be Ayla, a biblical port of Salomon. Aqaba is also known for its round-the-clock warm waters and spectacular coral reef in the Red Sea. </p>
