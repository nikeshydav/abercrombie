<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li><p><strong>Duration:</strong>  4 Nights</p>
<p>Explore Sapa and the area around this frontier town in the Lao Cai province in northwest Vietnam. It is one of the main market towns in the area where many ethnic minority groups such as H'mong, Dao and Tay live.</p>

<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Lao Cai/Sapa</h5>
<p>On arrival in the border town of Lao Cai transfer to the former hill station of Sapa. In the terraced hills and mountains of this area, the expansive green landscape is enlivened by the colors of its hill tribe population - flashes of shining silver jewelry from the necks and wrists of indigo-clad H'mong and the scarlet turbans worn by the Red Dao. It is here you will find hands stained with color from fabric dyes intricately embroidered into clothes, hats and purses.</p>
<p>
On a morning walking tour of Sapa, visit the busy market where Dao, H'Mong, Tay and other ethnic minority people converge from the surrounding countryside to sell their handicrafts and buy provisions. A light trek takes you to Sapa's quaint hill tribe villages set against Indochina's highest peak, Mt. Fansipan in the Hoang Lien Son Mountain Range, a picnic lunch will be had en-route. (Please note that appropriate footwear must be worn for the trek. If conditions are wet, programs may be diverted)</p>
<p>
The afternoon and evening is yours to continue discovering the area. Overnight at the Victoria Sapa Resort & Spa.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>Sapa</h5>
<p>Today take a light trek to a different valley to enjoy the sceneries of mountain rice terraces, waterfalls, buffaloes at work. Observe people at work in the fields, witness the traditional dyeing of clothes, and cross rivers by suspended bridges before returning to Sapa for lunch and an afternoon at leisure. Overnight at the Victoria Sapa Resort & Spa.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5> Sapa/Ethnic Market/Lao Cai/Hanoi</h5>
<p>After breakfast take a short drive to visit a local market. Different markets are open throughout the week, such as the Ban Cam on Tuesday, Cao Son on Wednesday, Lung Khau Nhin on Thursday, Can Cau on Saturday and Bac Ha on Sunday. You'll see mostly Flower Hmong but Phu La, Black Dao, Tay and Nung hill tribe groups also gather in these markets. Browse the variety of local products that are not found in other areas, such as the interesting animal market where pot-bellied pigs, cows and buffalos are traded.</p>
<p>
This afternoon take a short walk in a hill-tribe village, visiting local homes to understand more of daily tribal life, culture and traditions. In the late afternoon return to Lao Cai where you will have use of a hotel room to freshen up before taking the overnight Victoria Express train back to Hanoi.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>Hanoi</h5>

Inspired in design by the Masai manyatta, three separate camps of 6 to 12 suites each remember a bygone era. The stilted structures are adorned with graceful antiques, grand chandeliers and treasures collected from travels through Africa.

</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>Arrive Hanoi</h5>
<p>On arrival at Hanoi Airport, you will be met by an Abercrombie & Kent representative, and transferred by private vehicle to your hotel. Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam, has an eclectic mix of Asian and European influences with wide tree-lined avenues, beautiful lakes and over 600 temples. Hanoi has a lot to offer the visitor: see Ho Chi Minh's Mausoleum and the 11th century Quan Thanh Temple before exploring the bustling street life of the Old Quarter.</p>
<p>
On arrival, take a short visit to the mausoleum of the historic figure and father of modern Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh (viewed from outside; closed Monday and Friday and from October - November). Proceed to a wooden ethnic minority-style house which was his temporary residence from 1954 - 1969. In the same complex you will see the One Pillar Pagoda, founded by King Ly Thai To in 1049. This structure has become an important symbol for the people of Hanoi.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5> Hanoi/Street Food with Daniel/City tour</h5>
<p>Hit the streets of Hanoi for a half day street food tour with American chef/culinary instructor and food writer, Daniel Hoyer. A Hanoi resident and the author of five cookbooks, Daniel leads gastronomic adventure tours in Latin America and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>
Start the day with a Vietnamese ca phe (coffee) or tra (tea) with the locals at one of the many sidewalk cafes in the historic French Quarter, along with some fresh pastries that will be picked up on the way. An overview of the Vietnamese food scene, particularly in Hanoi will be given plus an introduction on the upcoming day's activities.</p>
<p>
Continue to a local market within the city to learn about and taste some of the ingredients used in the local cuisine and to watch the buying and selling rituals of a Vietnamese market. Daniel together with your Vietnamese guide will introduce you to some of the vendors, explain about the ingredients for sale and assist you with purchasing items to take home (if desired). Many photo opportunities will be available in this bustling, vibrant and colorful scene. Lunch at one of the great restaurants or street food operations in Hanoi, (location depending on the interest and depending on how venturous the group is) where you will sample and often observe the preparation of some of the city's best like, Cha Ca, Bun Cha, Bo la Lot, Bun Rieu, Nem Ran, etc. Throughout the morning Daniel will assist you with your choices and explain the various dishes to you. Following lunch, say goodbye to Daniel, transfer back to your hotel or continue to your onward destination.</p>
<p>
Your next stop will be the Temple of Literature, Vietnam's first university. Constructed in 1070, the gardens and well-preserved architecture offer a relaxing glimpse into Vietnam's past.</p>
<p>
Attend a traditional Mua Roi Nuoc show, a uniquely northern Vietnamese art form especially designed for depicting scenes from rural life and episodes of national history. Mua Roi Nuoc literally means "puppets that dance on water." The tradition dates back as far as the tenth century when it originated in the Red River Delta area of northern Vietnam. When the rice fields would flood the villages, villagers would entertain each other using this puppet form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>Hanoi/Duong Lam Village/Hue</h5>
<p>Duong Lam, situated northwest of Hanoi, is one of the few remaining ancient villages in the country. It has been recognized as a national relic boasting a twelve-hundred year history with many houses dating back 400 years.</p>
<p>
A tour to this area will give you a great chance to explore the ancient houses while wandering the narrow alleyways, also visit temples dedicated to the two kings born there, and most interesting of all, chat with locals living in the ancient houses.</p>
<p>
After your meal, continue driving to Mia Pagoda (another hamlet of Duong Lam), built in the 15th century, some 287 statues of all sizes can be seen here, along with famous sculptures such as the statue of Buddha and the statues of the 'Eight Vajra Deities'. Then, visit Ngo Quyen temple and Phung Hung temple, places dedicated to two national heroes - Ngo Quyen and Phung Hung. On the way back to Hanoi, stop at Tay Phuong Pagoda. The pagoda offers beautiful architecture and ancient and unique sculptures. It was one of the first pagodas built in Vietnam and has magnificent dragons and demons carved into the wooden roof. From here continue back to Hanoi, a 45-minute drive. On arrival in Hue, you will be met by an Abercrombie & Kent representative, and transferred by private vehicle to your hotel for check in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>Hue</h5>

<p>
Dine tonight at the private 'garden house' known locally as 'nha vuon' of one Hue's most famous architects. This traditional style house, which is set in a large and attractive formal garden, has connections with the ancient Hue Royal Imperial Court. The traditional architecture has long been associated with the natural environment and the ancient belief of 'feng-shui'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>Hue/Danang/Hoi An</h5>
<p>This morning depart your hotel for one hour panorama cyclo tour through this Old City to Tinh Tam Lake where Emperor used to come to relax; full of lotus flowers in summer there are many local style coffee shops around the lake where university students come to study.</p>  
 <p>
The cyclo then stops at Imperial Citadel for your visit. It is where the Nguyen Dynasty ruled between 1802 and 1945. The ancient citadel reflects the pomp and ceremony of the dynastic rulers as well as the scars of many years of turmoil, both ancient and modern (the Royal Citadel was badly damaged in the latter stages of the war) but retains a sense of grace and majesty even today. Continue by car to visit Thien Mu Pagoda, constructed in 1601, the 21-meter tall tower is the centerpiece of the pagoda. After your own lunch, leave Hue by road for Hoi An via the scenic fishing village of Lang Co and the Pass of Ocean Clouds. Stop in Danang to visit beautiful Non Nuoc Beach and the Cham Museum containing the finest collection of Cham sculpture in the world. Continue driving to Hoi An.</p>
 <p>
The ancient town of Hoi An was one of the major trading centres of south-east Asia in the 16th century, and was declared a World Cultural Heritage Site in 1999. Hoi An has a distinctive Chinese atmosphere with narrow streets and colourful houses decorated with lacquer panels engraved with Chinese characters.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>

<p>
Your afternoon tour takes you through Hoi An. Hoi An is a small city in central Vietnam on the coast of the South China Sea. A former harbour town, its situation on the estuary of the Thu Bon River made it an important trading centre in the 16th and 17th centuries and many Chinese, Japanese, Dutch and Indians settled there. A UNESCO World Heritage site, its buildings portray a unique blend of local and foreign influences and make it a good well-preserved example of a south eastern trading port of the time.

</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 7</h4>

On arrival in Ho Chi Minh City, you will be met by an Abercrombie & Kent representative, and transferred by private vehicle to your hotel. Ho Chi Minh City, located near the Mekong Delta, is the largest city in Vietnam. It began as a small fishing village and the area that the city now occupies was originally swampland and inhabited by the Khmer people of Cambodia. In 1698, a Vietnamese nobleman was sent by the Nguyen rulers of Hue to establish a Vietnamese administrative centre which resulted in detaching the area from the Cambodians who were not strong enough to intervene at that time. In 1859, the city - known as Saigon - was conquered and influenced by the French and today, the core is still adorned with wide elegant boulevards and historic buildings. Afternoon tour visits the Presidential Palace, Notre Dame Cathedral and the War Museum.</p>

Your 'room' is canvas but a permanent structure, very spacious and has a flush lavatory, solar lights and a good hot shower. Olonana is at the forefront of eco-tourism in Kenya with solar power, bio degradable products and an ingenious wetlands project which allows for all used water to be totally recycled and returned to the river clean.<br /><br />Lunch is served at the main cottage's lounge and dining area, its spacious verandah overlooks the river where the resident hippo pods spend their days wallowing.<br /><br />After lunch there is time to relax before enjoying an activity of your choice.<br /></p>";

A wide range of activities are offered at Olonana,your day can be as active or as leisurely as you wish. You can visit the adjacent Maasai village, take a morning bush walk with an armed ranger or enjoy sundowners in the evening or even dinner under the stars in the middle of the African bush.<br /><br />In the Mara, the wildlife is abundant and the swaying grasslands ensure that animals are never out of sight. Elephants browse amongst the large herds of wildebeest and topi, gazelle, eland and buffalo. The plains offer a rich variety of food for the dominant predators: lion, leopard, hyena and cheetah. In the Mara River, hippos submerge to snort and grumble while crocodiles sunbathe on the riverbanks. Around July to September, rain depending, the Masai Mara is host to the famous wildebeest migration which is one of the few remaining mass migrations of mammals in the world. During this time herds of over a million wildebeest will trawl their way through this region and they become the major focus for predatory activity and drama unfolds at every corner.<br /><br />There are also options for a morning balloon safari or a half-day visit to Lake Victoria.<br /><br />Balloon Safari: As the balloon is inflated against the first rays of sunrise your pilot will go through safety procedures. Once aloft, the balloon floats gently over the plains, giving a bird's eye view of the game below as the sun creeps slowly over the horizon. After around one hour the balloon lands and nearby breakfast is already being prepared and, of course, glasses of bubbly to toast your flight in a tradition initiated by the Montgolfier brothers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lake Victoria Adventure: An early start this morning with a transfer to take you to the airstrip for a flight by light aircraft to Lake Victoria. On arrival enjoy an appetising full English breakfast before you board the boat for the morning. There will be the opportunity to try fishing for the legendary giant Nile perch found in these waters as you explore the myriad of tiny islands in this region of the lake. An experienced and knowledgeable fisherman captains each boat. There is the chance to stop at a traditional fishing village and see how the villagers live from day to day before returning to the airstrip for your return flight to the Masai Mara.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p>";
