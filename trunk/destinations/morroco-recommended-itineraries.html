<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 7 days</p>
<p>This programme is designed to give a taste of Morocco - experience its culture, architecture and ancient monuments by exploring two of the major historical cities, Fes and Marrakech, in great detail.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong> Casablanca, Fes, Meknes, Volubilis, Marrakech.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>ARRIVE CASABLANCA/FES</h5>
<p>
Upon arrival in Casablanca, your guide will meet you and you will be driven to the Hassan II mosque in Casablanca before heading to Fes. Upon arrival you will be transferred to your hotel and the rest of the afternoon will be at leisure. </p>
   <p>
Fes is the oldest of the four imperial cities in Morocco. It dominated the country's religious, cultural and political life for thousands of years and was a protectorate of the French, who moved the capital to Rabat.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Riad Fes<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>FES</h5>
<p>
After breakfast, embark on a walking tour of the medieval medina with your private guide. Within the medina you will visit museums, busy souks, old schools and fondouks (old hotels for traders). Be sure to take in the ancient and astonishing architecture.</p>
<p>
After lunch, continue your exploration of Fes as you visit Riad Al Kantara. See how this beautiful place is being restored and learn from a master how to carve plaster and produce zellige (Moroccan ceramics). You will also have the opportunity to learn to prepare some traditional Moroccan bread.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Riad Fes<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>FES - MEKNES - VOLUBILIS - FES</h5>
<p>
After breakfast, meet your guide and travel by private vehicle to Meknes, another imperial city of Morocco. Visit the impressive monuments, royal stables and Moulay Ismail's Mausoleum.</p>
<p>
After lunch head to Volubilis, the site of the largest and most well preserved Roman ruins in Morocco. However, the greatest treasures of Volubilis are the superb mosaic floors which have been excellently preserved.</p>
<p>After sightseeing head back to Fes.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Riad Fes<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>FES - MARRAKECH</h5>
<p>
This morning, you are transferred to Fes Airport to board your chartered plane to Marrakech.</p>
<p>
Marrakech is the city of the south, also known as "the red city" due to the colours of the buildings. Founded by the Almoravid Berbers of the Western Sahara in 1062, Marrakech is one of the world's great cities, a place of legend and popularity that still manages to remain charged with mystery. The surrounding countryside, the flat plains, the High Atlas Mountains, all provide an unforgettable backdrop to one of the most sophisticated cities in Africa.</p>
<p>
On arrival at Marrakech Airport, you are met and privately transferred to Amanjena.</p>
<p>
This afternoon is spent sightseeing via horse-drawn carriages, visiting the beautiful Menara and Marjorelle gardens.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Amanjena<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>MARRAKECH</h5>
<p>
This morning, accompanied by your guide, set out to continue discovering the secrets of Marrakech.</p>
<p>
Pay a visit to the Ben Youssef Medersa (Koranic School) and the Ooubba Almoravides, the ablution centre for believers going to the mosque. With your expert guide take a walk through the old medina and labyrinthine souks, a maze of colourful alleys and small squares which are home to a bewildering number of stalls and ateliers devoted to specific crafts. Emerging from this maze, you find yourself in the famous Djemaa el Fna, the city's main square. No one is really certain how it came into being, but over the years the square has become the beating heart of Marrakech, where fire eaters, mime artists, snake charmers and street musicians perform at every turn.</p>
<p>
Right in front of the square you will find the Koutubia Mosque which is an emblem of Marrakech. Built in the 12th century, the Koutoubia minaret is the most perfect Islamic religious structure in North Africa. Koutoubia's minaret went on to inspire the architects of the Giralda of Seville and the Hassan Tower of Rabat. This famous landmark dominates the local skyline and can easily be spotted from anywhere in Marrakech. The tour ends at the El-Badi and Bahia Palaces.</p>
<p>
There is the option to visit and donate to a local community foundation that we support.</p>
<p>
There will be a guest speaker at dinner.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Amanjena<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>MARRAKECH</h5>
<p>
After breakfast, depart in a 4x4 for a rocky desert located approximately one hour from Marrakech.</p>
<p>
Visit a private stable which breeds Arab horses and, should you be so inclined, enjoy a brief ride on one of these remarkable creatures.</p>
<p>
Once in the desert, enjoy a short mountain bike ride before getting on horses to ride through the desert like true Berbers (non riders can follow in a 4x4) to your camp where you will be served lunch.</p>
<p>
Next there will be a demonstration of eagle and falcon flights. Possibly even try it yourself (depending on the mood of the animals), before seeing a Fantasia Show.</p>
<p>
Return back to your hotel and relax. Perhaps enjoy a hammam in the luxurious Amanjena spa.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Amanjena<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>DEPART MARRAKECH</h5>
<p>
Transfer to the airport to board your departure flight.</p>
<p>

Marrakech is the main city of the south, also known as "the red city" due to the colours of the buildings. Founded by the Almoravid Berbers of the Western Sahara in 1062, it is one of the world's great cities, a place of legend and popularity that still manages to remain charged with mystery. The surrounding countryside, the flat plains, the High Atlas Mountains, they all provide an unforgettable backdrop to one of the most sophisticated cities in Africa.</p>

<p>
Visit the Bahia Palace, a small piece of folly ordered in 1880 by the great vizier Sidi Moussa. A remarkable example of Moroccan architecture in the 19th century, it took 15 years to complete and gives a good idea of how the privileged lived during this time. Continue on to the Dar Si Said Museum, a smaller version of the Bahia Palace.</p>
<p>
Your day is not complete without ending up at the Djemâa el Fna square, with stalls of dried fruit or orange juice freshly pressed before you, and the multitude of small restaurants that take over its centre from early evening. No one really knows how it came into being, but over the years it has become the beating heart of Marrakech, where fire eaters, mime artists, snake charmers and street musicians perform at every turn.</p>
