Once aloft, the balloon floats gently over the plains, giving a bird's eye view of the game below as the sun creeps slowly over the horizon.

Originally built by Salah El-Din in 1176 to fortify the city against the Crusaders, it has never been without a military garrison. The Citadel was modified and enlarged over the centuries by subsequent rulers, most notably Muhammad Ali Pasha, one of the great builders of Modern Egypt, who was responsible for considerable alteration and building within the Citadel. Today it is a complex of four mosques and four museums, including the beautiful and graceful Mohamed Ali Mosque. Built from 1830 to 1857, the mosque also became the site of the great Ottoman ruler's tomb. From the arcaded courtyard, enjoy a magnificent view across the city to the pyramids in Giza.</p>

<h4>Day 12</h4>
<h5>CAIRO</h5>
<p>
After breakfast at hotel. Start a day tour with your Egyptologist to visit the pyramids of Sakkara and Dahshour.</p>
<p>Across the Great Court of the Pyramid Complex of Zoser in Sakkara, stands the Step Pyramid, the oldest known of Egypt's 107 pyramids, which was built by Imhotep, one of the world's most famous historical figures. This architect of the world's first freestanding stone structure, which you will visit today with your Egyptologist, is often also recognized as the world's first doctor, as well as a priest, sage, poet, and astrologer. Although the original structure was a burial chamber 28 metres underground, Imhotep enlarged it several times to eventually reach a six tiered rectangle 60 metres high. Sakkara seems to have been the first area where limestone was employed, not only for the outer casing of the pyramid but also to cover interior walls.</p>
<p>Founded around 3,100 BC during the Old Kingdom, Memphis is the legendary city of Menes, the King who united Upper and Lower Egypt. According to tradition, he first created dikes to protect the area from Nile floods and then started building. Much of what we know of Memphis comes from its necropolis, texts and papyrus from other parts of Egypt, and Herodotus, who visited the city. Early on, Memphis was probably a fortress from which Menes controlled the land and water routes between Upper Egypt and the Delta. Later, this great city became the administrative and religious center of Egypt, was home to a cosmopolitan community and most likely one of the largest and most important cities in the ancient world.</p>
<p>This southern extension of the necropolis of Sakkara is a field of Royal tombs about 3.5km long, only opened to tourists in 1996. Several pyramids can be found here, including the famed "Bent Pyramid". As one of the most unusual pyramids in Egypt, and also one of the best preserved as much of its casing remains, it has attracted considerable attention over the centuries. Another of the three pyramids at Dahshour which were built by the Pharaoh Sneferu, father of Cheops (of the Great Pyramid at Giza) is the Red Pyramid. This monument gets its common name from the reddish limestone used to build most of its core, but it is also sometimes referred to as the Shining or Northern Pyramid. It is the fourth highest pyramid ever built in Egypt, with almost 160 layers of stone. Significantly, the Red Pyramid was the first successful, true, cased Pyramid built in Egypt. Together, these pyramids represent the transition from the step-pyramid of Sakkara to the smooth-sided pyramids of Giza.</p>
<p>Lunch will be served at a local restaurant.</p>
<p>Return to hotel and enjoy the rest of day at leisure.</p>
