<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong>  12 days</p>
<p>Ideal for first time visitors to Peru, this programme visits many of the country's highlights including Colca Canyon, Lake Titicaca and Machu Picchu.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong> Lima, Arequipa, Colca Canyon, Juliaca, Puno, Cusco, Urubamba, Machu Picchu.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>ARRIVE LIMA</h5>
<p>Evening arrival at Lima International Airport, you will be met and transferred to your hotel.</p>
<p>
The city of Lima was founded by the Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro on January 5, 1535, the eve of the Epiphany of the Magi - from which it derived its evocative original name of La Ciudad de los Reyes or "The City of Kings". It is a city of rare fascination and unexpected pleasures. Lima has decaying colonial splendour and the teeming vitality of an oriental bazaar; melancholy cloudy winters and warm breezy summers; impoverished urban sprawl and quiet elegant corners among ancient buildings where the night air is scented with jasmine.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Miraflores Park Hotel</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>LIMA - AREQUIPA - COLCA CANYON</h5>
<p>In the morning, you will be transferred to the airport for your flight to Arequipa. On arrival in Arequipa you will be met and transferred by private vehicle on a scenic drive to Colca, approximately four hours outside Arequipa. A winding road leaves the city, finally arriving at one of the most beautiful places on earth: the Colca Canyon. Local geologists claim that Colca, with chasms that can measure up to 11,000 feet top to bottom, is the world's deepest canyon. </p>
<p>The valley has beautiful pre-Columbian terraces that are still farmed by native collaguas.</p>
<p>Rest of the afternoon is at your leisure, there are many different activities available at your hotel.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Casitas del Colca<br />

<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>COLCA CANYON - AREQUIPA</h5>
<p>Early this morning depart for the Condor Cross, a location at which you will have an opportunity to observe these magnificent birds gliding over the canyon and around mountain peaks.</p>
<p>
Midmorning, transfer back to Arequipa. Box Lunch included.</p>
<p>
Afternoon visit Arequipa's main square, Cathedral and Santa Catalina's Monastery, the most important and impressive religious monument of Peru. Founded in 1579 it was closed until 1970. Arequipa's narrow streets, gardens and squares have Spanish names and are reminsicent of the old neighbourhoods of Granada and Sevilla.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Libertador Arequipa Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>AREQUIPA - JULIACA - PUNO</h5>
<p>This morning you will be transferred to the airport for your flight to Juliaca. Upon your arrival in Juliaca, you will be met and transferred to your hotel in Puno.</p>
<p>
On the way, visit the mysterious pre-Inca cemetery at Sillustani.  Sillustani's circular burial towers or chullpas overlook Lake Umayo. It is believed that the chullpas were used as burial chambers for the nobles of the Colla civilisation.</p>
<p>
Rest of the day will be at your leisure.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Libertador Puno Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>PUNO</h5>
<p>Today you have a full day excursion to Lake Titicaca. Lake Titicaca, at 3820 metres, is the highest navigable lake in the world. At over 170 kilometres long, it is also the largest lake in South America. Its altitude means the air is unusually clear and the azure waters particularly striking.</p>
<p>
Sightseeing on the islands of Uros and Taquile are followed by lunch at a local restaurant in Taquile. The floating islands of the Uros, a small tribe (now intermarried, so pure-blooded Uros no longer exist), is an interesting excursion. The islands themselves are constructed from the tortura reed found in abundance in Lake Titicaca. The Uros' homes and boats are also made of tortura, and their entire lives revolve around their famed reed-weaving.</p>
<p>
On the island of Taquile inhabitants dress in homemade traditional colourful clothing - men in elegant waistcoats and floppy knit caps, women in layered skirts and embroidered blouses. Quechua is their language and they maintain a very individual and independent lifestyle. This beautiful island setting holds several terraced hillsides of Inca ruins which you are free to explore.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Libertador Puno Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>PUNO - JULIACA - CUSCO</h5>
<p>Early morning transfer to the airport for your flight to Cusco. Upon arrival in Cusco you will be met and transferred to your hotel.</p>
<p>After a light lunch at the hotel, enjoy a city tour which includes the Cathedral on the Plaza de Armas and the Santo Domingo Temple, a Dominican Church and convent built on the foundations of the Koricancha or "place of gold",  the Incas principal religious building dedicated to the worhsip of the sun.</p>
<p>
Just outside of Cusco, your visit this afternoon takes you to the ruins of Sacsayhuaman, a testimonial to Incan architectural skills.  Compiled of massive stones (one weighs 125 tons) you are challenged to try to slip a piece of paper between the cracks of these blocks, cut and fitted together with incredible precision without a single drop of mortar to hold them in place. This ancient fortress, where the greatest battle between the Spanish and Incas took place, overlooks the red-tiled roofs of Cusco and the spectacular lush countryside. Also visit Qenqo ("The Labyrinth"), an Incan shrine dedicated to the Earth Mother.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Monasterio Cusco Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 8</h4>
<h5>CUSCO - URUBAMBA</h5>
<p>Today you will enjoy a full day tour with guide to the market of Chincheros, a town of Inca origin. Its church was one of the most important colonial era churches with Baroque altars and walls with richly painted scenes. Its Sunday fair draws country folk once a week from all corners of the valley to exchange their products.</p>
<p>
You will stop for a delicious lunch in the charming Hacienda Huayocari, where the Lambarri-Orihuelas family will be your hosts.  You will be able to see their valuable collection of Colonial and folk art. Located on the summit of a hill sheltered amidst Andean peaks, you will find from here one of the finest views of the Sacred Valley of the Incas.</p>
<p>
After lunch, continue on to the massive fortress of Ollantaytambo.  A formidable stone structure that climbs massive terraces to the top of a peak, this was the valley's main defence against the Antis and was the site of the Incas' greatest victory against the Spanish during the wars of conquest. Constructed of rose-coloured granite, this huge installation was once a thriving complex of baths, temples and military barracks. Below the fortress lies a complete Incan town, also called Ollantaytambo, still inhabited and with its original architecture and layout preserved.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Sol y Luna Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 9</h4>
<h5>URUBAMBA - MACHU PICCHU</h5>
<p>This morning you board your train bound for Machu Picchu where a late morning arrival gives you time to begin your explorations of this breathtaking Incan citadel.</p>
<p>
Accompanied by your guide, explore the city's ruins, and feel its pulse as you visualise the lives of the priests, craftsmen and servants who inhabited this seemingly uninhabitable citadel.  Excavations at the site have revealed skeletons, artifacts and woolen clothing, but no gold. The same precision of assembled stones exists here as in other Incan sites. Overlooking the raging Urubamba River and discovered in a hidden tangle of vines and trees atop the mountain, the city of Machu Picchu will forever hold its secret of its destruction - the Incas left no written record.</p>
<p>
While in Machu Picchu you will be accommodated at the Machu Picchu Santuary Lodge which enjoys a unique position at the entrance of the Inca Citadel ruins, at 8,200 feet above sea level.</p>
<p>

<h5>MACHU PICCHU - CUSCO</h5>

<p>
This morning you have the opportunity to take one of two famous hikes with your guide. The first is to Inti Punku, or Sun Gate, which is the entry point to Machu Picchu on the Inca Trail and offers excellent views of the ruins, (approx 2 hours). The second is the chance to hike up the Huayna Picchu - the highest mountain which is actually part of the ruins, from where you are afforded excellent views of the surrounding area, as well as a unique view of the famous "lost city", (approx 2.5 hours). </p>
<p>
Afternoon you will board your train to Cusco, where a representative  will be waiting to transfer you to your hotel.</p>

Continue on to the historic Cathedral, built in 1534 and an architectural marvel. From the Cathedral, you walk past the Presidential Palace where the soldiers guarding the palace offer an excellent photo opportunity, then onto the church of San Francisco and its library collection of fine paintings and frescoes.

Whether this is your first time on safari or a return trip, the Serengeti will not disappoint.<br /><br />The Serengeti National Park is arguably the most famous national park in the world. The Serengeti perhaps defines the safari experience as surely as the wildlife that inhabits it. Established in 1951, and covering an area of almost 15,000 square kilometers, an area comparable to the state of Connecticut or Northern Ireland, the Serengeti hosts a fantastically diverse ecosystem. The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, when 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other game that follow close behind make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";

<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong>  9 days </p>
<p>A 9 day soft adventure itinerary visiting Lima, Cusco, the Sacred Valley and Machu Picchu.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong>  Lima, Cusco, Urubamba, Machu Picchu. </p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>ARRIVE LIMA</h5>
<p>On arrival at Lima International Airport this evening, you will be transferred to your hotel.</p>
<p>The city of Lima was founded by the Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro on January 5, 1535, the eve of the Epiphany of the Magi - from which it derived its evocative original name of La Ciudad de los Reyes or "The City of Kings". It is a city of rare fascination and unexpected pleasures. Lima has decaying colonial splendour and the teeming vitality of an oriental bazaar; melancholy cloudy winters and warm breezy summers; impoverished urban sprawl and quiet elegant corners among ancient buildings where the night air is scented with jasmine.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Miraflores Park Hotel</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>LIMA - CUSCO - URUBAMBA</h5>
<p>This morning you are transferred to the airport for your flight to Cusco, an Andean community and former ancient capital of the Inca Empire.</p>
<p>
Upon arrival in Cusco, you are met and transferred to the Urubamba Valley to the local village of Pisac, known for its famous colourful market. This bustling market attracts tourists from all over the world to try their hand at bartering for local sweaters, ponchos, wall hangings, jewellery and goods.</p>
<p>Continue to your hotel for check-in and lunch.</p>
<p>
After lunch, continue on to the fortress of Ollantaytambo, a formidable stone structure that climbs massive terraces to the top of a peak. It was the valley's main defense against the Antis and was the site of the Incas' greatest victory against the Spanish during the wars of conquest. Constructed of rose-coloured granite, this huge installation was once a thriving complex of baths, temples and military barracks. Below the fortress lies a complete Incan town, also called Ollantaytambo, still inhabited and with its original architecture and layout preserved.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Sol y Luna Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>URUBAMBA</h5>
<p>This morning your full day tour starts with a visit to Chincheros, a town of Inca origin. Its colourful, well attended Sunday fair draws countryfolk once a week from all corners and heights of the valley to exchange their products.</p>
<p>Continue with a 2-3 hour hike which offers an opportunity to enjoy both the archaeological and aesthetic qualities of the Sacred Valley. The hike begins at the picturesque town of Maras, 67 km north of Cusco. The town itself has a colonial feel, and the nearby salt mines present excellent photographic opportunities. From there you will hike the 7 km to Maras, a fascinating archaeological site comprising a series of concentric agricultural terraces, some as deep as 150 m, while enjoying the magnificent views this part of the Sacred Valley offers.</p>
<p>Following this activity, you will enjoy a served picnic lunch in the picturesque town of Maras.</p>
<p>After lunch return to your hotel. Rest of the day will be at your leisure. Relax or choose between the activities offered by your hotel such as mountain biking and trekking.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Sol y Luna Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>URUBAMBA</h5>
<p>This morning after a transfer down into the valley, you will join rubber rafts of eight people for a rafting experience. Following a safety and familiarisation briefing, start your river run that lasts around 1.5 hours. On the river see a world behind the scenes of Andean life - a timeless parade of shepherds, schoolchildren and farmers.</p>
<p>Enjoy a picnic lunch in the country.</p>
<p>This afternoon your tour starts with a coffee or tea and a briefing about the tour, horses, safety, and riding methods. There are horses for all abilities. Please advise your riding level before booking so we can prepare the right horse for you. This 2-3 hour ride will give you the unique experience of riding in one of the most fascinating regions of the Andes, the Sacred Valley. There are many places to visit including the salt pans of Salinas, the old village of Pichingote, the lively market town of Urubamba, or the wonderful farmland and the Quechua communities of the valley, while becoming familiar with our beautiful Peruvian Paso Horses.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Sol y Luna Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5> URUBAMBA - MACHU PICCHU</h5>
<p>This mornng you will take the train at the station in Ollanta and follow the ever-narrowing gorge to the Urubamba River. Here you will start your half-day hike along the famous Inca Trail to Machu Picchu. As you approach Machu Picchu, the valley turns into a canyon and vegetation changes to that of a cloud forest.</p>
<p>
Past the Chachabamba ruins, a three hour ascent through highland grasses and small valleys brings you to Wiñay  Wayna. From here, a winding trail though the cloud forest, which cuts across a ridge, brings you at last to the door of the sun, Intipunku, with a spectacular view of the citadel below, and the original entrance to Machu Picchu.</p>
<p>
During the six hour hike, you will be served a picnic lunch.</p>
<p>
For those who prefer the traditional route to the ruins, you can continue on the train with a guide, you will be rejoined by the hiking group at Machu.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Machu Picchu Sanctuary Lodge<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>MACHU PICCHU - CUSCO</h5>
<p>This morning you may rise early and enjoy a walk through Machu Picchu at sunrise, something which many believe to be the highlight of a visit to Machu Picchu.</p>
<p>
This morning accompanied by your guide, explore the city's ruins, and feel its pulse as you visualise the lives of the priests, craftsmen and servants who inhabited this seemingly uninhabitable citadel. Excavations at the site have revealed skeletons, artifacts and woolen clothing, but no gold. The same precision of assembled stones exists here as in other Incan sites. Overlooking the raging Urubamba River and discovered in a hidden tangle of vines and trees atop the mountain, the city of Machu Picchu will forever hold its secret of its destruction - the Incas left no written record.</p>
<p>
Afternoon you will join your train to Cusco, where a representative will be waiting for you to transfer to your hotel in Cusco.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Monasterio Cusco Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>CUSCO</h5>
<p>This morning, enjoy a city tour which includes the Cathedral on the Plaza de Armas and Santo Domingo, a Dominican church and convent built upon the foundations of the Koricancha, or the "place of gold", the Incas' principal religious building dedicated to the worship of the sun.</p>
<p>
After seeing the sights of the ancient city, your visit will take you to the ruins of Sacsayhuaman, a true testimonial to Incan architectural skills. Compiled of massive stones (one weighs 125 tons) you are challenged to try to slip a piece of paper through the cracks in between these blocks, cut and fitted together with incredible precision without a single drop of mortar to hold them in place. This ancient fortress where the greatest battle between the Spanish and Incas took place overlooks the red-tiled roofs of Cusco and the breathtaking countryside surrounding the city. Also visit Qenqo. "The Labyrinth", an Incan shrine dedicated to Pachamama (Mother Earth) and the small fortress of Puka Pukara.</p>
<p>
Afternoon will be at your leisure.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Monasterio Cusco Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 8</h4>
<h5>CUSCO - LIMA</h5>
<p>Morning transfer to airport for your flight to Lima. On arrival, you will be met and taken to your hotel.</p>
<p>
This afternoon you embark on a city tour beginning with a visit to Plaza Mayor, the official centre of the city and the original site on which Lima was founded. Continue on to the historic Cathedral, built in 1534 and an architectural marvel. From the Cathedral, walk past the Presidential Palace where the soldiers guarding the palace offer an excellent photo opportunity, then onto the church of San Francisco and its library collection of fine paintings and frescoes. From the historic centre, you travel through modern Lima and visit the fascinating Archaeological Museum, showcasing the progression of Peru's various early civilisations - from the Chavin in 1200 BC to the Incas.</p>

A wide range of activities are offered at Olonana and you can plan your day to be as active or as leisurely as you wish. Visit the adjacent Maasai village, take a morning bush walk with an armed ranger or enjoy sundowners in the evening or even dinner under the stars in the middle of the African bush.<br /><br />In the Mara, the wildlife is abundant and the swaying grasslands ensure that animals are never out of sight. Elephants browse amongst the large herds of wildebeest, topi, gazelle, eland and buffalo. The plains offer a rich variety of food for the dominant predators: lion, leopard, hyena and cheetah. In the Mara River, hippos submerge while crocodiles sunbathe on the riverbanks.<br /><br />Around July to September, rain depending, the Masai Mara is host to the famous wildebeest migration which is one of the few remaining mass migrations of mammals in the world. During this time herds of over a million wildebeest will trawl their way through this region and they become the major focus for predatory activity and drama unfolds at every corner.<br /><br />There are also options for a morning balloon safari or a half-day visit to Lake Victoria.<br /><br />Balloon Safari: As the balloon is inflated against the first rays of sunrise your pilot will go through safety procedures. Once aloft, the balloon floats gently over the plains, giving a bird's eye view of the game below as the sun creeps slowly over the horizon. After around one hour the balloon lands as breakfast is already being prepared and, of course, enjoy a glass or two of bubbly to toast your flight in a tradition initiated by the Montgolfier brothers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lake Victoria Adventure : An early start this morning with a transfer to the airstrip for a flight by light aircraft to Lake Victoria. On arrival enjoy an appetising full English breakfast before you board the boat for the morning.
