<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 9 days</p>
<p>Romance, magic and mystery all make the heart beat a little faster, and Peru is the perfect location to experience all three. Entice your sense of taste when you learn to prepare, and then sample, Peruvian specialties with a cooking lesson from an experienced chef. Explore ancient Inca sites, trying to unravel their mysteries as you feel the magic of the impressive ruins and Andean landscapes; and reconnect with each other at fabulous restaurants and hotels that welcome you as if you were on your honeymoon, capping off your time with an emotional vow renewal ceremony in the mist-shrouded citadel of Machu Picchu.

 </p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>India/Lima, Peru</h5>
<p>Arrive in Lima, a city with remnants of colonial splendor and teeming vitality, where you are met and transferred to your hotel. Your romantic holiday begins the moment you check in and discover honeymoon amenities in your deluxe ocean-view suite.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Miraflores Park Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> None
</p></li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Lima</h5>
<p>This morning, meet a Lima chef and visit a local market to shop for ingredients for your cooking class. Leave the groceries in the chef's house and take a walk around the Barranco area, known for its mansions, the Bridge of Sighs and the Dedalo Art Gallery. As you stroll, your mouth waters at the thought of the delicious lunch of ceviche and tapas that you and the chef are about to prepare. When you return home, you can recreate the tempting dishes in your own kitchen and relive memories of your romantic journey. After lunch, embark on a city tour that visits the Plaza Mayor, the heart of the city and original site on which Lima was founded. Continue to the historic Cathedral, passing by the Presidential Palace and the Church of San Francisco with its library of fine paintings and frescoes. When you are ready to settle in for the night, have your private bath butler draw a steamy bath for two - an ideal way to soothe tired muscles and share memories of your exciting day.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Miraflores Park Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>Lima/Cusco/Urubamba</h5>
<p>Board a morning flight to Cusco, an Andean community and former capital of the Inca Empire. On arrival, you are transferred to Urubamba, the Sacred Valley of the Incas, and your hotel. The rest of the day is at leisure to adjust to the altitude. This evening, sit down to a special romantic dinner in the hotel and anticipate the amazing sights you are about to see over the next few days.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Hotel Rio Sagrado <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>Urubamba/Chincheros/Urubamba</h5>
<p>Chincheros is a town of Inca origin, and its colorful weekly fair draws country folk from throughout the valley to exchange goods. Wander the market today and see what treasures you may find as souvenirs. Afterward, meet Nilda Calla?aupa Alvarez, a native of Chinchero. She learned to weave as a child while tending the flocks in the fields of her village and now regularly travels to the U.S. to organize weaving exhibits and workshops. View some of her work and take time to shop before you have lunch at Huayoccari Hacienda, home to an interesting collection of Colonial and folk art. After lunch, continue to the massive fortress of Ollantaytambo, a formidable stone structure that climbs massive terraces to the top of a high peak. Below the fortress lies a complete Incan town, also called Ollantaytambo, still inhabited and with its original architecture and layout preserved.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Hotel Rio Sagrado <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>Urubamba/Machu Picchu</h5>
<p>Board the deluxe Hiram Bingham train, the most luxurious way to travel the breathtaking landscape to Machu Picchu. Step on board, and you are immersed in an elegant world of polished wood, gleaming cutlery and glittering glass that evokes a romantic ambience. After a light lunch on board, arrive at the breathtaking Incan citadel and begin exploring the ruins in the company of your expert guide. Feel the pulse of this magical place as you visualize the lives of the priests, craftsmen, and servants who inhabited this seemingly uninhabitable citadel and then left, leaving no written records about its destruction. After a busy day of sightseeing, return to your beautiful mountainside retreat, high in the lush Andean clouds forest. It features the look and feel of a rural Andean village set in spectacular grounds with paths that wind past waterfalls and gardens, and trails that wander through wild forest. Snuggle under a thick alpaca blanket in your suite, which offers incredible views of the exotic gardens or the dramatic Vilcanota River.

</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Inkaterra Machu Picchu Pueblo Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>Machu Picchu/Cusco</h5>
<p>Return to Machu Picchu with your guide this morning for a final look at the ruins - and for an even more meaningful event for you. A shaman joins you to perform a vow renewal ceremony for you. Stand before the spirits of the Incas and reaffirm your love in this magical place. Afterward, return to the hotel, renewed and refreshed, for lunch. This afternoon, return to Cusco by Vista dome train and settle in at your hotel, where you receive VIP amenities.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Hotel Monasterio   <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>Cusco</h5>
<p>A morning city tour takes you to the Cathedral on the Plaza de Armas and the Santo Domingo Temple, a Dominican church and convent built on the foundations of the Koricancha (place of gold), where the Incas worshipped the sun. Continue just outside Cusco to the ruins of Sacsayhuaman, a testimonial to the Incan architectural skills. Try to slip a piece of paper between the cracks of the massive stone blocks, cut and fitted together with incredible precision without a single drop of mortar to hold them in place. Your afternoon is at leisure. Make sure to visit the hotel spa for a relaxing couple's massage. This evening, enjoy a romantic dinner at Limo restaurant, overlooking the main plaza.</p>

<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong>  9 days </p>
<p>A 9 day soft adventure itinerary visiting Lima, Cusco, the Sacred Valley and Machu Picchu.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong>  Lima, Cusco, Urubamba, Machu Picchu. </p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>ARRIVE LIMA</h5>
<p>On arrival at Lima International Airport this evening, you will be transferred to your hotel.</p>
<p>The city of Lima was founded by the Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro on January 5, 1535, the eve of the Epiphany of the Magi - from which it derived its evocative original name of La Ciudad de los Reyes or "The City of Kings". It is a city of rare fascination and unexpected pleasures. Lima has decaying colonial splendour and the teeming vitality of an oriental bazaar; melancholy cloudy winters and warm breezy summers; impoverished urban sprawl and quiet elegant corners among ancient buildings where the night air is scented with jasmine.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Miraflores Park Hotel</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>LIMA - CUSCO - URUBAMBA</h5>
<p>This morning you are transferred to the airport for your flight to Cusco, an Andean community and former ancient capital of the Inca Empire.</p>
<p>
Upon arrival in Cusco, you are met and transferred to the Urubamba Valley to the local village of Pisac, known for its famous colourful market. This bustling market attracts tourists from all over the world to try their hand at bartering for local sweaters, ponchos, wall hangings, jewellery and goods.</p>
<p>Continue to your hotel for check-in and lunch.</p>
<p>
After lunch, continue on to the fortress of Ollantaytambo, a formidable stone structure that climbs massive terraces to the top of a peak. It was the valley's main defense against the Antis and was the site of the Incas' greatest victory against the Spanish during the wars of conquest. Constructed of rose-coloured granite, this huge installation was once a thriving complex of baths, temples and military barracks. Below the fortress lies a complete Incan town, also called Ollantaytambo, still inhabited and with its original architecture and layout preserved.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Sol y Luna Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>URUBAMBA</h5>
<p>This morning your full day tour starts with a visit to Chincheros, a town of Inca origin. Its colourful, well attended Sunday fair draws countryfolk once a week from all corners and heights of the valley to exchange their products.</p>
<p>Continue with a 2-3 hour hike which offers an opportunity to enjoy both the archaeological and aesthetic qualities of the Sacred Valley. The hike begins at the picturesque town of Maras, 67 km north of Cusco. The town itself has a colonial feel, and the nearby salt mines present excellent photographic opportunities. From there you will hike the 7 km to Maras, a fascinating archaeological site comprising a series of concentric agricultural terraces, some as deep as 150 m, while enjoying the magnificent views this part of the Sacred Valley offers.</p>
<p>Following this activity, you will enjoy a served picnic lunch in the picturesque town of Maras.</p>
<p>After lunch return to your hotel. Rest of the day will be at your leisure. Relax or choose between the activities offered by your hotel such as mountain biking and trekking.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Sol y Luna Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>URUBAMBA</h5>
<p>This morning after a transfer down into the valley, you will join rubber rafts of eight people for a rafting experience. Following a safety and familiarisation briefing, start your river run that lasts around 1.5 hours. On the river see a world behind the scenes of Andean life - a timeless parade of shepherds, schoolchildren and farmers.</p>
<p>Enjoy a picnic lunch in the country.</p>
<p>This afternoon your tour starts with a coffee or tea and a briefing about the tour, horses, safety, and riding methods. There are horses for all abilities. Please advise your riding level before booking so we can prepare the right horse for you. This 2-3 hour ride will give you the unique experience of riding in one of the most fascinating regions of the Andes, the Sacred Valley. There are many places to visit including the salt pans of Salinas, the old village of Pichingote, the lively market town of Urubamba, or the wonderful farmland and the Quechua communities of the valley, while becoming familiar with our beautiful Peruvian Paso Horses.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Sol y Luna Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5> URUBAMBA - MACHU PICCHU</h5>
<p>This mornng you will take the train at the station in Ollanta and follow the ever-narrowing gorge to the Urubamba River. Here you will start your half-day hike along the famous Inca Trail to Machu Picchu. As you approach Machu Picchu, the valley turns into a canyon and vegetation changes to that of a cloud forest.</p>
<p>
Past the Chachabamba ruins, a three hour ascent through highland grasses and small valleys brings you to Wi?ay Wayna. From here, a winding trail though the cloud forest, which cuts across a ridge, brings you at last to the door of the sun, Intipunku, with a spectacular view of the citadel below, and the original entrance to Machu Picchu.</p>
<p>
During the six hour hike, you will be served a picnic lunch.</p>
<p>
For those who prefer the traditional route to the ruins, you can continue on the train with a guide, you will be rejoined by the hiking group at Machu.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Machu Picchu Sanctuary Lodge<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>MACHU PICCHU - CUSCO</h5>
<p>This morning you may rise early and enjoy a walk through Machu Picchu at sunrise, something which many believe to be the highlight of a visit to Machu Picchu.</p>
<p>
This morning accompanied by your guide, explore the city's ruins, and feel its pulse as you visualise the lives of the priests, craftsmen and servants who inhabited this seemingly uninhabitable citadel. Excavations at the site have revealed skeletons, artifacts and woolen clothing, but no gold. The same precision of assembled stones exists here as in other Incan sites. Overlooking the raging Urubamba River and discovered in a hidden tangle of vines and trees atop the mountain, the city of Machu Picchu will forever hold its secret of its destruction - the Incas left no written record.</p>
<p>
Afternoon you will join your train to Cusco, where a representative will be waiting for you to transfer to your hotel in Cusco.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Monasterio Cusco Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>CUSCO</h5>
<p>This morning, enjoy a city tour which includes the Cathedral on the Plaza de Armas and Santo Domingo, a Dominican church and convent built upon the foundations of the Koricancha, or the "place of gold", the Incas' principal religious building dedicated to the worship of the sun.</p>
<p>
After seeing the sights of the ancient city, your visit will take you to the ruins of Sacsayhuaman, a true testimonial to Incan architectural skills. Compiled of massive stones (one weighs 125 tons) you are challenged to try to slip a piece of paper through the cracks in between these blocks, cut and fitted together with incredible precision without a single drop of mortar to hold them in place. This ancient fortress where the greatest battle between the Spanish and Incas took place overlooks the red-tiled roofs of Cusco and the breathtaking countryside surrounding the city. Also visit Qenqo. "The Labyrinth", an Incan shrine dedicated to Pachamama (Mother Earth) and the small fortress of Puka Pukara.</p>
<p>
Afternoon will be at your leisure.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Monasterio Cusco Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 8</h4>
<h5>CUSCO - LIMA</h5>
<p>Morning transfer to airport for your flight to Lima. On arrival, you will be met and taken to your hotel.</p>
<p>
This afternoon you embark on a city tour beginning with a visit to Plaza Mayor, the official centre of the city and the original site on which Lima was founded. Continue on to the historic Cathedral, built in 1534 and an architectural marvel. From the Cathedral, walk past the Presidential Palace where the soldiers guarding the palace offer an excellent photo opportunity, then onto the church of San Francisco and its library collection of fine paintings and frescoes. From the historic centre, you travel through modern Lima and visit the fascinating Archaeological Museum, showcasing the progression of Peru's various early civilisations - from the Chavin in 1200 BC to the Incas.</p>

Visit the adjacent Maasai village, take a morning bush walk with an armed ranger or enjoy sundowners in the evening or even dinner under the stars in the middle of the African bush.<br /><br />In the Mara, the wildlife is abundant and the swaying grasslands ensure that animals are never out of sight. Elephants browse amongst the large herds of wildebeest, topi, gazelle, eland and buffalo. The plains offer a rich variety of food for the dominant predators: lion, leopard, hyena and cheetah. In the Mara River, hippos submerge while crocodiles sunbathe on the riverbanks.<br /><br />Around July to September, rain depending, the Masai Mara is host to the famous wildebeest migration which is one of the few remaining mass migrations of mammals in the world. During this time herds of over a million wildebeest will trawl their way through this region and they become the major focus for predatory activity and drama unfolds at every corner.<br /><br />There are also options for a morning balloon safari or a half-day visit to Lake Victoria.<br /><br />Balloon Safari: As the balloon is inflated against the first rays of sunrise your pilot will go through safety procedures. Once aloft, the balloon floats gently over the plains, giving a bird's eye view of the game below as the sun creeps slowly over the horizon. After around one hour the balloon lands as breakfast is already being prepared and, of course, enjoy a glass or two of bubbly to toast your flight in a tradition initiated by the Montgolfier brothers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lake Victoria Adventure : An early start this morning with a transfer to the airstrip for a flight by light aircraft to Lake Victoria. On arrival enjoy an appetising full English breakfast before you board the boat for the morning. There will be the opportunity to try fishing for the legendary giant Nile perch found in these waters as you explore the myriad of tiny islands in this region of the lake. An experienced and knowledgeable fisherman captains each boat. There is the chance to stop at a traditional fishing village and see how the villagers live from day to day before returning to the airstrip for your return flight to the Masai Mara.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p>";

<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong>   8 days</p>
<p>Discover Peru with this FIT itinerary that visits the country's major highlights.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong> Lima, Cusco, the Sacred Valley, Machu Picchu.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>ARRIVE LIMA</h5>
<p> Evening arrival at Lima International Airport, you will be met and transferred to your hotel.</p>
<p>
The city of Lima was founded by the Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro on January 5, 1535, the eve of the Epiphany of the Magi - from which it derived its evocative original name of La Ciudad de los Reyes or "The City of Kings". It is a city of rare fascination and unexpected pleasures. Lima has decaying colonial splendour and the teeming vitality of an oriental bazaar; melancholy cloudy winters and warm breezy summers; impoverished urban sprawl and quiet elegant corners among ancient buildings where the night air is scented with jasmine.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Miraflores Park Hotel</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>LIMA</h5>
<p>
The morning is at leisure. Enjoy lunch at the Rosa Nautica Restaurant, overlooking the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>
This afternoon you are taken on a tour of the "City of the Kings".  Visit the historical centre of Lima. See the Plaza Mayor, the location of the Government Palace, the City Hall, the Cathedral and the Archbishop's Palace. The rich, religious history of the Spanish colonies is displayed in these buildings. You will also have time to see the San Francisco Monastery. Continue sightseeing with a drive through the fashionable residential districts of San Isidro and Miraflores and finally Monterrico, where you visit the dazzling collection of the Gold Museum. The Museo de Oro del Peru has numerous artifacts of gold, silver and precious stones.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Miraflores Park Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>LIMA - CUSCO</h5>
<p>This morning you are transferred to the airport for your flight to Cusco, an Andean community and former ancient capital of the Inca Empire.</p>
<p>
Upon arrival in Cusco, you are met and transferred to your hotel.  The rest of the morning is left free to relax and acclimatise, as you are now at 3400 metres altitude. We recommend minimal activity and the local remedy of coca tea, (which is in plentiful supply), for those who are susceptible.</p>
<p>
After a light lunch at your hotel, enjoy a city tour which includes the Cathedral on the Plaza de Armas. The Santo Domingo Temple is a Dominican Church and convent built on the foundations of the Koricancha or "place of gold",  the Incas principal religious building, dedicated to the worhsip of the sun.</p>
<p>
Just outside of Cusco your visit this afternoon takes you to the ruins of Sacsayhuaman, a testimonial to Incan architectural skills.  Compiled of massive stones (one weighs 125 tons) you are challenged to try to slip a piece of paper between the cracks of these blocks, cut and fitted together with incredible precision without a single drop of mortar to hold them in place. This ancient fortress where the greatest battle between the Spanish and Incas took place, overlooks the red-tiled roofs of Cusco and the spectacular lush countryside. Also visit Qenqo ("The Labyrinth"), an Incan shrine dedicated to the Earth Mother and the small fortress of Puka Pukara.</p>
   <p>
Your tour will end with a cocktail at the Quinta Colcampata, a beautiful historic house overlooking the city of Cusco.</p>

<strong>Overnight:</strong> Monasterio Cusco Hotel<br/>
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>CUSCO - MACHU PICCHU</h5>
<p>This morning you board the new deluxe Orient Express train to Machu Picchu, where a late morning arrival gives you time to begin your explorations of this breathtaking Incan citadel. Light lunch will be served on board. Upon arrival at Aguas Calientes train station, a bus ride will bring you to the ruins of Machu Picchu.</p>
<p>
Accompanied by your guide,  explore the city's ruins, and feel its pulse as you visualise the lives of the priests, craftsmen and servants who inhabited this seemingly uninhabitable citadel.  Excavations at the site have revealed skeletons, artifacts and woolen clothing, but no gold. The same precision of assembled stones exists here as in other Incan sites. Overlooking the raging Urubamba River and discovered in a hidden tangle of vines and trees atop the mountain, the city of Machu Picchu will forever hold its secret of its destruction - the Incas left no written record.</p>
<p>
While in Machu Picchu you will be accommodated at the Machu Picchu Santuary Lodge which enjoys a unique position at the entrance of the Inca citadel ruins, at 8,200 feet above sea level.</p>

<strong>Overnight:</strong> Machu Picchu Sanctuary Lodge<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>MACHU PICCHU - CUSCO</h5>
<p>
The morning you may rise early and enjoy a walk through Machu Picchu at sunrise, something which many consider to be the  highlight of a visit to Machu Picchu.</p>
<p>
This morning, you will have the opportunity to take one of two hikes with your guide. The first hike is to Inti Punku, or famous Sun Gate, which is the entry point to Machu Picchu on the Inca Trail and offers excellent views of the ruins, (approx 2 hours). The second is the chance to hike up the Huayna Picchu - the highest mountain which is actually part of the ruins, from where you are afforded excellent views of the surrounding area, as well as a unique view of the famous "lost city", (approx 2.5 hours).  Or if you prefer you can just relax and continue exploring this magnificent citadel on your own.
Lunch will be at your hotel.</p>
<p>
Late afternoon enjoy tea-time at the Machu Picchu Sanctuary Lodge.<br />
Early evening board your Hiram Bingham train back to Cusco. Gourmet dinner will be served on board. Upon arrival in Cusco a representative will be waiting to transfer you to your hotel.</p>

<strong>Overnight:</strong> Monasterio Cusco Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>CUSCO - URUBAMBA - CUSCO</h5>
<p>
This morning depart for the Urubamba Valley to the local village of Pisac, known for its colourful market. This bustling market attracts tourist from all over the world to try their hand at bartering for local sweaters, ponchos, wall hangings, jewelry and goods. </p>
<p>
You will have time to shop before enjoying lunch at the Huayoccari Hacienda. The Lambarri-Orihuelas, a family of great collectors, will be your hosts. You will be able to appreciate a valuable collection of Colonial and folk art. Located on the summit of a hill sheltered amidst Andean peaks, you will find here one of the finest views of the Sacred Valley of the Incas.</p>
<p>
After lunch, continue on to the massive fortress of Ollantaytambo.  A formidable stone structure that climbs massive terraces to the top of a peak, this was the valley's main defense against the Antis and was the site of the Incas' greatest victory against the Spanish during the wars of conquest. Constructed of rose-coloured granite, this huge installation was once a thriving complex of baths, temples and military barracks. Below the fortress lies a complete Incan town, also called Ollantaytambo, still inhabited and with its original architecture and layout preserved. </p>  
<p>
Dinner today will be at the restaurant in the Pre-Columbian Art Museum. This house was an Inca ceremonial court around 1450. In 1580 it became the mansion of the conqueror Alonso D?az and in 2003 it was restored to become the Pre-Columbian Art Museum. This extraordinary Cusco historic monument holds the only museum in Peru dedicated the arts of ancient Peruvian cultures. After dinner you will have the opportunity to visit the museum.</p>

Enjoy a full day exploring the Serengeti by 4WD vehicle with thrilling morning and afternoon game drives. Whether this is your first time on safari or a return trip the Serengeti will not disappoint.<br /><br />The Serengeti National Park is arguably the most famous national park in the world. The Serengeti perhaps defines the safari experience as surely as the wildlife that inhabits it. Established in 1951, and covering an area of almost 15,000 sq km, an area comparable to the state of Connecticut or Northern Ireland, the Serengeti hosts a fantastically diverse ecosystem. The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, where 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other plains game that follow close behind, make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";

All excursions are escorted by an experienced armed guide.<br /><br />Selous Sand Rivers is situated on the banks of the Rufiji River, offering a unique combination of adventure, comfort and exclusivity. This small luxury lodge, crafted out of local materials, comprises six individually designed cottages with en-suite bathrooms. Spaced along the river bank, each has its own private view of the wide sand-banked river with its hippos, crocodiles and birdlife.

The Selous supports around one million game animals, is bigger than Switzerland and is a World Heritage site.

Transfer from Arusha to Ngorongoro Crater Lodge located on the rim with spectacular views across the crater. The Ngorongoro Crater is the largest unbroken caldera in the world and the first sight of it is breathtaking.<br /><br />Ngorongoro Crater Lodge is situated on the edge of the ancient crater rim above the cool, swirling mists. The lodge is a return to the noble elegance of the travelling colonials. Inspired in design by the Maasai Manyatta, three separate camps of 6 to 12 suites each remember a bygone era when characters such as Lord Delamere adorned the stilted, handcrafted structures with graceful antiques, grand chandeliers and treasures collected from travels through Africa.<br /><br /></p>";

Rhinos can often be seen with calves at heel. Eland and waterbuck appear not to notice the human visitors, enabling photographers to shoot at ease. On the lake in the middle of the crater you may see thousands of flamingos fluttering and shimmering like a pink heat haze. Zebra and wildebeest account for almost half the animals.
