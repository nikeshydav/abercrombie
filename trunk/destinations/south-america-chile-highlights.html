<dt><h2>Santiago</h2> 
<p>Santiago is a perfect taster of what Chile has in store for its visitors, greeting them with the majestic set of the Andes in the background. This vibrant capital city sits in the Great Central Valley, which is almost exactly half way from Chile's coastline. </p>
<div class="thepet">
<p>Santiago has a wealthy concentration of excellent museums including Chilean Museum of Pre-Columbian Art which house a vast collection of Mesoamerican and South American artifacts from Olmec, Maya and Inca civilizations. It is also a renowned gastronomy hub, with a host of world class restaurants and bars. It is also where one can shop for the prized semi precious gem, Lapis lazuli which is principally sourced only in Chile and Afghanistan. Lapis lazuli artworks may also be found in Bellavista, which stuns with its colorful bohemian streets. Another must visit is Santa Lucia, a small hill in the centre of Santiago, from where one can view panoramic views of the city.</p>

<dd><img src="../images/Valparaiso.jpg"  alt="Valparaiso" /></dd>
<dt><h2>Valparaiso</h2> 
<p>Valparaiso is a bustling port and one of Chile's most important seaports and reachable from Santiago by road. It has been affectionately called 'Little San Francisco' and 'The Jewel of the Pacific' by the visitors in the past. </p>
<div class="thepet">
<p>Valparaiso is situated on 27 different hills on the Peru- Chile trench and overlooks Pacific Ocean which bestows the city with a labyrinth of streets and cobbled alleys. It is said that the house of the Chilean Nobel Prize winning poet, Pablo Neruda in La Sebastiana has one of the best views of the Pacific. It may be noticeable that Valparaiso lost some of its charm after the opening of Panama Canal in 1914, however it was declared UNESCO World Heritage Site later and has been restored since.</p>

<dt><h2>Wine Country</h2> 
<p>Chile's favorable climate and topography has blessed it with a wealth of vineyards that has made it a significant destination for wine connoisseurs. The Wine Country embraces Santiago from north, south and west and showcases distinctive geographical characteristics with each of its valley.</p>
<div class="thepet">
<p>The Wine Country is easily  accessible from the capital city and visitors can enjoy a day trip of exploring  vineyards and wine tasting. Sample the famous fine red wines of the Maipo River  Valley or the crispy chilled whites of the Casablanca Valley. Then there is the  famous Carmenere, Chile&rsquo;s signature grape found in the Colchagua Valley. A  visit to the Wine Country indeed bestows one with an insight of the Chile&rsquo;s  world famous wines which are now renowned for their distinctive flavors.</p>

<h2>The Atacama Desert</h2> 
<p>The colossal plateau stretching over 600 miles, The Atacama Desert is the driest on the earth, in heart of which sits the oasis town of San Pedro de Atacama. This rustic adobe town just out of a fairytale is alive with its charming open terraced restaurants, handicraft markets and charismatic hotels. </p>
<div class="thepet">
<p>This Pacific Coast land-strip has also been significant for scientific reasons as NASA tested its space expedition instruments in an appropriately dubbed, 'Valle de la Luna' or Valley of the Moon. Its landscape has been hailed as one of its kind on the planet and often compare to that of planet Mars itself. For the adventurous kinds, Atacama Deserts has plenty on offer! Witnessing its 'altiplano' for instance can be awe inspiring experience with its stunning color spectrums and volcanic backdrop. This vast desert plain also offers a number of adventure sport possibilities such as sand boarding, hiking, horseback riding, and it is also home to the famous Rally Dakar since 2009.</p>

<dt><h2>The Lake District</h2> 
<p>The Lake District is jeweled with sapphire blue fresh water bodies snuggled up in lush green rain-forested valleys in the backdrop of snowcapped volcanic Andes Mountains. </p>
<div class="thepet">
<p>Lake District used to be the territory of the formidable Mapuche tribe who successfully defended their home against the Spanish for nearly three centuries. Once the Mapuche negotiated with the Chilean regime, European settlements soon populated the region, and even today there is a strong German presence in the countryside with its charming alpine towns and villages. Similar to other Chilean regions, Lake District is also brimming with sporting activities such as hiking, rafting, horseback riding, mountain climbing as well as bird watching. Moreover, southern cities of Puerto Montt and Puerto Varas offer convenient access to the Bariloche in Argentina across the border through road and water.</p>

<dd><img src="../images/Southern-Patagonia.jpg"  alt="Southern Patagonia" /></dd>
<dt><h2>Southern Patagonia</h2> 
<p><strong>Sightseeing in Chile</strong> is incomplete without a visit to this natural wonder! Southern Patagonia boasts of one of the most dramatic landscapes on the globe that complement its equally dramatic southern most position on Earth. Although this region is the largest in Chile, it is inhibited by only 1% of its population that survives in an unscathed form of nature.
</p>
<div class="thepet">
<p>Punta Arenas which was once an important access point to Chilean Patagonia through the Straights of Magellan is teeming with a rich maritime heritage. When one visits Torres del Paine National Park in the north, the true face of Patagonia emerges, with the spectacular visual treats of vertical granite peaks, with the crystallized glaciers calving into the water bodies, and valleys brimming with Andean flora and fauna, including the Andean condor and the enigmatic puma.</p>
<p>If one really wants to make their Chilean expedition once in a lifetime experience then travel to the real 'end of the world' point, i.e. Cape Horn, located far to the South of the Straights of Magellan. This summit had for long teased the explorers and sailors from all over the world. Visitors can also marvel at Chile's untouched and uninhabited wilderness in the Darwin Range, christened after the English biologist who was on board the voyage of the Beagle in the 19th century.

<dt><h2>Easter Island</h2> 
<p>Easter Island, also known as 'Rapa Nui' in Polynesian is possibly world's largest outdoor museum. Much of this island is protected under 'Rapa Nui National Park and is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site. </p>
<div class="thepet">
<p>Rapa Nui is one of the world's most isolated inhabited islands and best known for its famous Moai statues, found in hundreds all over the island which were created by early indigenous people inhabiting the region. These mystical structures have for centuries amazed the historians and some of them stand up to 20 metres (65 ft) tall. This incredible island is one of the most must see <strong>tourist places in Chile</strong> and accessible from Santiago via a five hour flight.</p>
