<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong>  8 days  </p>
<p>An exciting 8 day exploration of Russian customs and traditions based around the Maslenitsa celebration (pancake week that takes place the week proceeding Shrove Tuesday). The itinerary is based on a group of 20 but can be adapted for a FIT enquiry or a different sized group.</p>

</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>Arrive St. Petersburg</h5>

<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>St. Petersburg</h5>
<p>Your private vehicle and guide will collect you and drive you throughout the historical city centre to see main city sights - Nevsky Prospect, Palace Square, Winter Palace, Admiralty and Vasilevsky Island. Visit Peter & Paul Fortress inside which was the first construction of St Petersburg put up by Peter the Great in 1703 to provide protection from the Swedes. The Fortress Cathedral is the burial place of most of Russia's Tsars and Tsarinas from the 18th century onwards, including Peter the Great. You might also wish to visit St Isaac's Cathedral. It was built between 1818 and 1858, by the French-born architect Auguste Montferrand, to be one of the most impressive landmarks of the Russian Imperial capital. Wonderful views can be enjoyed from the colonnade (although this does require visitors to climb 300 steps!).</p>

<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>St. Petersburg</h5>
<p>Today travel with your private vehicle and guide outside the city to visit Tsarskoe Selo (renamed Pushkin in 1937 to commemorate the centenary of famous Russian poet's death). You may visit the summer palace, created for Catherine I, expanded and redesigned for Empress Elizabeth and remodeled again for Catherine the Great. The baroque Catherine Palace, whose exterior features golden domes and blue and white facade mouldings, suffered extensive wartime damage, but is today a masterpiece of restoration thanks to the reinstatement of the world-famous Amber Room that enhances the interior that gleams and glitters with mirrors, chandeliers and gilded woodcarvings.</p>
<p>
Afterwards travel to Pavlovsk and participate in an Old Russian entertainment - riding on Russian Troika. The three harnessed horses take you for a ride on the traditionally decorated carriage. The fervent ring of the bells tied to a bridle, will be your accompanying music.</p>
<p>
Afterwards enjoy traditional hearty Russian lunch at Podvorie Dacha which resembles a Russian terem (wooden palace): pickles, cold cuts, salads, borsch, pancakes with ice cream and copious quantities of vodka. The restaurant is housed in a typical Russian log house and its interior is filled with wooden panels and bear skins hanging on the walls of the restaurant. A relaxed, informal atmosphere is the basic component of this style. The specialties include shashlik grilled in the spacious yard of the restaurant, boiled beef with spicy sour cream and garlic sauce, soup from a pumpkin with foie gras and berries. This restaurant in recent years has hosted President Putin's birthday celebrations and also has renowned for its excellent and lively folklore performances - you are invited to join in and learn some energetic Russian traditional dances.</p>
<p>Evening at leisure.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Grand Hotel Europe<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>St. Petersburg and Moscow</h5>
<p>Today, travel with your private vehicle and guide to the Hermitage Museum. The museum is situated in the lavishly decorated Winter Palace and occupies six magnificent buildings with 3 million pieces of artwork dating from the Stone Age to modern times. The main building and largest part of the museum is the rococo-style Winter Palace, residence of the Czars from 1762 to 1917. The museum was commissioned by Catherine the Great and she and her successors built the Hermitage collection in large part with purchases of the private collections of the Western European aristocracy and monarchy.</p>
<p>
Afterwards you have a unique chance to get to know Russians better. You will have tea at an apartment of a famous Russian artist, a local of St. Petersburg. Yuri Petrochenko and his wife Neli live in a flat in an 18th century mansion. Their house is a small museum where you can see old portraits, icons, antique furniture and numerous pieces of Russian Art. Yuri himself is a great Russian artist famous abroad for his painting on ceramics, and especially his collection of ceramic Eggs with modern painting on. Neli will cook delicious Russian pasty and tell many interesting stories about this intriguing country and its people.</p>
<p>

</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>Moscow</h5>
<p>Today have full day sightseeing tour with you private vehicle and guide starting with magnificent Red Square visit. The square is the focal point of the city lying on the east wall of the Kremlin, surrounded by a thick red fortress wall. Originally a market, the square itself was established around the end of the 15th century when Ivan III ordered all wooden buildings in the vicinity of the Kremlin to be demolished to protect the Kremlin from fires. You might wish to visit St. Basil Cathedral, built in times of Ivan the Terrible. There is a legend around it that the Tsar ordered to blind the architects so they would never create anything as beautiful as this Cathedral.</p>
<p>
Afterwards, travel to the New Maiden Convent, one of the city's most beautiful architectural ensembles with a long history behind its toothed walls. Founded as a fortress in the south of Moscow it gradually became a place of political activity. The adjacent New Maiden Cemetery is Moscow's most prestigious resting place after the Kremlin wall, containing the tombs of Chekhov, Shostakovich, Stanislavsky, Khrushchev, Gromyko, Molotov, Raisa Gorbachev and others.</p>
<p>

Visit the Peter and Paul Fortress, the historical nucleus of the city as well as one of the most interesting and beautiful architectural landmarks. The Peter & Paul Cathedral with its long gilded spire is the burial place of all Russian emperors from Peter the Great to the last of the Romanovs - Tsar Nicholas II.

Zebra and wildebeest account for almost half the animals - gazelle, buffalo, eland, hartebeest and wart hog can also be seen.<br /></p>";

The Serengeti perhaps defines the safari experience as surely as the wildlife that inhabits it. Established in 1951, and covering an area of almost 15,000 square kilometers, an area comparable to the state of Connecticut or Northern Ireland, the Serengeti hosts a fantastically diverse ecosystem. The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, when 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other game that follow close behind make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";

He applies the same techniques as on paper, but using different materials. His designs have been influenced by the avant-garde periods of such artists as Malevich, Kandinsky, and Souietine. Some of his designs show the influence of the pre-revolutionary "Imperial" period. This influence is very apparent in some of his exquisite porcelain eggs. Two of which has been bought by Malcolm Forbes for his collection of Fabergé Eggs. Since 1978, Yuri Petrochenkov has been visiting Western European countries and the U.S.A., where he exhibits and sells his works, and teaches his special techniques of porcelain painting.

Once aloft, the balloon floats gently over the plains, giving a bird's eye view of the game below as the sun creeps slowly over the horizon. After around one hour the balloon lands as breakfast is already being prepared and, of course, enjoy a glass or two of bubbly to toast your flight in a tradition initiated by the Montgolfier brothers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lake Victoria Adventure : An early start this morning with a transfer to the airstrip for a flight by light aircraft to Lake Victoria. On arrival enjoy an appetising full English breakfast before you board the boat for the morning. There will be the opportunity to try fishing for the legendary giant Nile perch found in these waters as you explore the myriad of tiny islands in this region of the lake. An experienced and knowledgeable fisherman captains each boat. There is the chance to stop at a traditional fishing village and see how the villagers live from day to day before returning to the airstrip for your return flight to the Masai Mara.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p>";
