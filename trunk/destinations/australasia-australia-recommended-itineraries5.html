<p>
The giant red monolith has come to represent Australia itself. The massive sandstone rock - the summit of a buried mountain - generates an almost mystical power. 'The Rock' is 8.8 kilometres around the base, 3.6 kilometres long, 2.4 kilometres wide and towers 348 metres above the surrounding plain. The Anangu people believe they are the direct descendents of the ancestral spirits who gave them the laws and rules that they live by. They believe they are responsible for the protection of the lands and ask visitors to respect their wishes not to climb the rock. Its significant power can be felt particularly in the early morning or at sunset as the Rock undergoes an extraordinary transformation of colour.</p>

<h4>Day 9</h4>
<h5>Mossman - Cape Tribulation - Mossman</h5>
<p>After breakfast this morning meet your guide in the hotel lobby for your full day 4WD exploration of the Daintree Rainforest & Cape Tribulation. You will travel through the rich farming areas toward the World Heritage Listed forest region of Cape Tribulation, where you step aboard a personalized craft for a cruise on the mirrored smooth waters of the Daintree River. You will cruise close to riverbanks and under the overhead canopy of the rainforest seeking out the vivid Ulysses Butterfly, Kingfishers and various other wildlife. The cruise takes you through silent backwaters where crocodiles can normally be seen basking on the muddy banks.</p>
<p>
Arriving on the northern side of the river you will then enter the Cape Tribulation section of the Wet Tropics World Heritage protected rainforest. The journey takes you up the beautiful Alexandra Range passing through rainforest waterfalls and on to the first stop for home-style morning tea deep in the rainforest at the Jindalba boardwalk. Jindalba (the aboriginal name for this place) is also where you literally immerse yourself inside the protected forests and go on a guided walk where you view plants of ancient linage right through to examples of more recent species of flowering plants.</p>
<p>
Continuing along the Cape Tribulation road, you then stop at the magical Thornton Beach. Here your guide will highlight the amazing wildlife and ecosystems unique to this part of the world - "where the rainforest meets the sea". You are often the only people on this stretch of wilderness beach and many who have travelled remark how they feel like Robinson Crusoe. This is also where Cooper Creek uniquely meets up with the Coral Sea.</p>
<p>
Lunch is a special treat today, deep under the Rainforest canopy. You will enjoy a delicious lunch of tropical rainforest-inspired local produce. You have the chance for a private rainforest walk here as well, and may possibly spot rainforest lizards, birds, butterflies and perhaps even marsupials! This is also your opportunity to immerse yourself in the fresh, clear, rainforest creek.</p>
<p>
A lasting impression will be at the outstanding panoramic picture postcard view at Alexandra Range Lookout. From here you'll have a spectacular view of the mouth of the Daintree River, Snapper Island and on a clear day right through to Port Douglas. One final treat for the day is the crossing on the Daintree River Ferry - the iconic vehicle punt which transfers you out of the world heritage rainforest and on to your home-ward road. You will be back at your accommodation early in the evening.</p>
<p>
Please note during wet season the itinerary may change due to higher water levels.</p>

Sydney, the capital of the state of New South Wales, is Australia's most well known city. With its extraordinary icons both natural and man-made this is a city that never fails to please the eye. It's magnificent natural harbour spanned by the 'coat hanger', the Sydney Harbour Bridge, and the man-made sails of the Sydney Opera House are just some of its most widely photographed views.</p>

<h5>Sydney</h5>
<p>After breakfast this morning meet your guide in the hotel lobby for your morning sightseeing tour of the harbour city.</p>
<p>
Today's tour begins at Sydney's historic Rocks area known for its narrow cobbled streets and convict buildings. Continue past the historic Mint and Hyde Park Barracks and stop at Mrs Macquarie's Chair for wonderful views of the Harbour, Opera House and Harbour Bridge. From here journey on by private vehicle to the Sydney Opera House for a private, behind-the-scenes tour of this Australian icon.</p>
<p>
50 years ago a young Danish architect named Jorn Utzon dreaming of Bennelong Point, designed a masterpiece which pushed the boundaries of creativity and science - and put Sydney on the map forever. Step inside the world's most recognisable sails for a one hour tour and experience the miracle of architecture and engineering. A work of art that came into existence against impossible odds - to become one of the busiest performing arts centres in the world! Working with a new enriching interactive and audio visual component, where images are projected onto the fabric of the building - our guides will take you on an emotional journey, engrossing you in a story to rival any opera plot with its dramatic twists and turns.
You'll visit one of the major venues - where there are live performances every day. Some 1500 performances, in every genre you can imagine, are staged each year to audiences of around one million.</p>
<p>
From here your guide will escort you along Circular Quay to Campbell's Cove pontoon where your private charter vessel awaits.</p>
<p>
This afternoon you will be orientated with Sydney from the most enviable vantage point - on the water! Cruising on Sydney Harbour is a quintessential Australian experience, and today you will experience 'Calypso' - a 52 foot motor cruiser that is crewed & privately yours.</p>
 <p>
Whilst cruising this iconic harbour you will have the opportunity to swim, fish or kayak. However most choose to sit back with a glass of Australian beer or wine & take in the amazing sights - the Harbour Bridge, the Opera House, Luna Park, Fort Denison and the waterfront homes of the rich & famous. A barbeque lunch is served on board, while anchored in a secluded cove. And as the afternoon sun comes in we suggest making your way to the bow and settling in the sunbeds for the perfect views of the harbour city as you come back in to moor. Your 4 hour experience on the water ends at Campbell's Cove pontoon in the late afternoon, just a short walk from your hotel.</p>
<p>
For dinner this evening we recommend a restaurant reservation at Aria.</p>

The Whale Shark is the largest member of the shark family, the largest fish in the world and suprisingly, a harmless plankton eater! Reported to reach 18 metres in length, the whale shark is easily identified by its pattern of white spots. Thought to mainly inhabit worldwide temperate and tropical seas, it is rarely seen in shallow coastal water, but is a daily visitor to the Ningaloo Reef between late March and July. Up to 12 Whale Sharks have been spotted close to the reef feeding (Whale Shark tours operate March - July). Manta Rays with wingspans several metres wide, as well as a variety of tropical fish and turtles can be seen year round.</p>

Once aloft, the balloon floats gently over the plains, giving a bird's eye view of the game below as the sun creeps slowly over the horizon. After around one hour the balloon lands as breakfast is already being prepared and, of course, enjoy a glass or two of bubbly to toast your flight in a tradition initiated by the Montgolfier brothers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lake Victoria Adventure : An early start this morning with a transfer to the airstrip for a flight by light aircraft to Lake Victoria.

<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong>   13 days</p>
<p>This itinerary showcases places that you would have seen on the Oprah Winfrey show on Australia. It is an ideal itinerary for the first time visitor to Australia.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong> Melbourne, Kangaroo Island, Uluru, Hamilton Island, Sydney </p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>Arrive Melbourne</h5>
<p>On arrival into Melbourne you will be met by your guide and chauffeur and transferred by private vehicle to your hotel. Your accommodation is available for immediate occupancy.</p>
<p>
Melbourne, the capital of the state of Victoria, is known as the garden, arts and sports capital of Australia. Its beautiful tree-lined boulevards, many parks, gardens and beautiful Victorian terrace houses, great restaurants, wonderful theatre and art galleries, together with international sporting events all combine to make this elegant city one of the world's most liveable.</p>
<p>
After meeting your guide visit Cook's Cottage before taking a walk through the unique Royal Botanic Gardens, laid out over 150 years ago and reputed to be the finest in the Southern Hemisphere. Delight in the over 10,000 species and 50,000 individual plants in the 38 hectare gardens, including trees and plants of great cultural value. Many of these plants are irreplaceable, endangered or even extinct in the wild and have become a natural sanctuary for native wild life including black swans, bell birds, cockatoos and kookaburras that fill the air with their distinctive song. Travel past Victorian terrace houses, the city's exclusive suburbs and the Arts precinct before returning to the hotel at the 'Paris End' of the city.</p>
<p>
The Park Hyatt Melbourne is the city's most deluxe hotel. It is located at the 'top end' of Collins Street, directly opposite Melbourne's grandest cathedral and a few steps from Parliament House, the central business district and the beautiful Fitzroy Gardens. The luxurious oversized rooms are a haven for relaxation and comfort. This evening enjoy all inclusive evening drinks and canapés in the Club lounge.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Park Hyatt Melbourne</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Melbourne</h5>
<p>This morning meet your local guide raconteur Kenneth Park, a museum and art curator by profession, who will take you on a private walking tour of the National Gallery of Victoria.  The NGV's Australian Collection is located at Federation Square displaying one of Australia's finest Aboriginal Art collections. All of the very best Australian artists are represented in the collections.</p>
<p>
Explore Federation Square - a mixed-use development covering an area of 3.2 hectare and centred around two major public spaces.  The entire precinct is built on top of a concrete deck over busy railway lines and was opened in 2002.  It is Victoria's second most popular tourist attraction, attracting 8.41 million visitors in 2009.  Its design has caused much controversy since its first planning and continued to divide opinion after its opening. Despite this, the precinct continues to expand.  Federation square is the site at which Oprah Winfrey was greeted by thousands of fans on her visit to Melbourne in December 2010. Kenneth also takes you through the city's labyrinth of atmospheric arcades and alleyways - a wonderful way to learn Melbourne's architectural and cultural heritage. Have a special interest? Kenneth will tailor-make his walk just for you!</p>
<p>
This evening enjoy drinks and canapés in the Club lounge.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Park Hyatt Melbourne<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>Melbourne - Kangaroo Island</h5>
<p>After breakfast this morning meet your chauffeur in the hotel lobby and transfer by private vehicle to the Melbourne Domestic Airport. Depart Melbourne for Kangaroo Island (via Adelaide).</p>
<p>
Kangaroo Island is the place where you can quietly 'go bush' and see native Australian animals and birds as they were meant to be seen in the wild. Half the native bushland on Kangaroo Island remains just as it was when British navigator Matthew Flinders put a name to this untamed wilderness in 1802. And more than one-third of the Island is National or Conservation Park. Kangaroo Island is a true wildlife sanctuary. Owing to its isolation from the mainland, the Island has suffered less from the impact of European settlement and retains more than half of its native 'old-growth' vegetation - a vast area of some 2,250 square kilometres. The Island has been spared the damage done by foxes and rabbits, ensuring the integrity of native bushland and animal and bird populations have thrived. Kangaroo Island's prolific wildlife includes penguins, Australian sea lions, New Zealand fur seals, varied birdlife, koalas and echidnas, all revelling in the protected environs.</p>
<p>
On arrival in Kangaroo Island you will be transferred to your accommodation at Southern Ocean Lodge. Southern Ocean Lodge is Kangaroo Island's only world-class wilderness lodge. Located at Hanson Bay and commanding spectacular ocean, beach and wilderness views, the 21-suite escape offers the ultimate fusion of nature and luxury. Featuring an environmentally sensitive design, eco chic interiors, platinum lodge facilities, personal service, contemporary dining and a signature spa retreat, guests can discover the magnificent coastal scenery and abundant wildlife for which the Island is renowned in impeccable style.</p>

<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>Kangaroo Island - Adelaide - Uluru</h5>
<p>This morning depart Kangaroo Island for Uluru (Ayers Rock) via Adelaide. On arrival into Uluru you will be met by a representative of Longitude 131° and transferred to your accommodation.</p>
<p>
The new 'safari' style luxury tented site is the first of its kind in Australia. Built on the very edge of Uluru Kata Tjuta National Park, the fifteen individual tents have uninterrupted views over Uluru. Relax in the free-form swimming pool and enjoy an aperitif on the balcony as the sunsets over the desert, or simply lie in bed and watch the stars rise over the outback. Inside the tent, the atmosphere is lavish with expansive stone floors, beautiful bed linen and unique bathrooms and air conditioning. This is a special place where you will connect with the desert landscape and its magnificent natural wonders. At the Dune House enjoy a quiet drink, good food and the company of newfound friends.</p>
<p>
Uluru is a giant red monolith that has come to represent Australia itself. The massive sandstone rock - the summit of a buried mountain - generates an almost mystical power. The Rock is 8.8 kilometres around the base, 3.6 kilometres long, 2.4 kilometres wide and towers 348 metres above the surrounding plain. The Anangu people believe they are the direct descendents of the ancestral spirits who gave them the laws and rules that they live by. They believe they are responsible for the protection of the lands and ask visitors to respect their wishes not to climb the rock. Its significant power can be felt particularly in the early morning or at sunset as the Rock undergoes an extraordinary transformation of colour.</p>
<p>
This afternoon is at your leisure at Longitude 131°. You will have the opportunity to select your touring in the Red Centre upon check-in.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Longitude 131<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>Uluru</h5>
<p>This morning, you may choose to enjoy an exclusive walking tour of the local bushland.  An interpretive guide will accompany you, explaining in great detail the dynamic ecology that exists in this harsh environment.  Guests will learn what food sources exist around them, which plants can be used for medicinal purposes, how to find tracks left by the movements of nocturnal fauna, and where to look to spot daytime fauna such as the local bird-life (using spotting binoculars). Each guest is encouraged to identify the many different plants, tracks and wildlife as they smell, touch and taste their bush surroundings.</p>
<p>
To climb the world's largest monolith is against the wishes of the traditional owners, the Anangu, because the path you would otherwise follow is the traditional route taken by their ancestral Mala (rufus hare-wallaby men) on their arrival at this scared place. A base walk will, however, offer you a deeply personal, moving and lasting experience.</p>
<p>
Departing Longitude 131° mid-afternoon, this tour travels into the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park Cultural Centre, a vibrant and engaging place of learning with more than a few surprises (don't miss the bulging folder of letters from previous visitors apologising for souveniring pieces of rock - the tales of regret and 'mysterious ill fortune' are fascinating). With a greater understanding of one of the world's truly ancient cultures, guests drive around Uluru and see for themselves the sites, which are so sacred to the traditional owners. A walk into the Mutitjulu waterhole offers each guest a unique insight into the sheer physical and spiritual enormity of Uluru. During the walk, the guide will point out cave paintings and other relevant sites important to Anangu and the early explorers.</p>
<p>
You will be returned to Longitude 131° to freshen up before enjoying sunset champagne and canapés atop our secluded sand dune with stunning 360° views of Uluru and Kata Tjuta. From there, you will be taken to an exclusive desert setting where dinner will be served under a glittering canopy of stars. A resident astronomer will join you to explain how our sun, earth and galaxy interact, the almost unfathomable distances involved in space travel, and how our ancestors navigated land and sea on countless voyages of discovery. Guests are regaled with tales of the southern night sky and famous constellations such as the signs of the zodiac, Seven Sisters, Southern Cross and Orion's Belt.</p>

Whether this is your first time on safari or a return trip the Serengeti will not disappoint.<br /><br />The Serengeti National Park is arguably the most famous national park in the world. The Serengeti perhaps defines the safari experience as surely as the wildlife that inhabits it. Established in 1951, and covering an area of almost 15,000 sq km, an area comparable to the state of Connecticut or Northern Ireland, the Serengeti hosts a fantastically diverse ecosystem. The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, where 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other plains game that follow close behind, make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";
