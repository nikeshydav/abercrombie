<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>ST. PETERSBURG - PETRODVORETS - ST. PETERSBURG</h5>
<p>
Today is another morning for wearing comfortable shoes as you travel by private vehicle to visit Petrodvorets (Peterhof), the great summer estate and artistic gem of Peter the Great, nestled on the shore of the Gulf of Finland (part of the Baltic Sea). After his victory over the Swedes at Poltava in 1709 Peter decided to build a palace 'befitting to the very highest of monarchs' and a visit to Versailles in 1717 furthered these ambitions. Over 5,000 laborers, serfs and soldiers were employed in the creation of this magnificent estate that was officially opened in 1723. A prominent highlight is the Grand Cascade, a delightful sequence of 37 gilded bronze sculptures, 64 fountains and 142 water jets descending from the terraces of the Great Palace to the Marine Canal and the sea. The park features numerous palaces, summer houses and pavilions, including the Hermitage, specifically designed for holding Imperial dinner parties. We offer early entrance to the Palace (before opening hours) to avoid crowds.</p>
<p>

<h4>Day 8</h4>
<h5>ST PETERSBURG</h5>
<p>This morning, leave the city and drive out to the countryside to the village of Pushkin (formerly known as Tsarskoye Selo), renamed in 1937 on the centenary of the famous Russian poet's death. Visit the grounds of the sparkling Catherine Palace. This palace was built in the mid 18th century for Tsarina Elizabeth, who named it the Catherine Palace in honor of her mother. The yellow and blue façade with its snowy white columns is one of the most famous examples of Russian baroque architecture.</p>
<p>
Enjoy lunch in a rustic country restaurant, Podvorie, with traditional folk entertainment.</p>
<p>
This afternoon, visit Pavlovsk Great Palace. Originally part of Tsarskoye Selo, the estate was a gift of Catherine the Great to her son, Paul. The great Scottish architect, Charles Cameron, was commissioned to design the subtly elegant buildings and the park itself was designed by the Italian Gonzago. The palace's style varies as relations between Paul and his mother Catherine were strained. When Paul I ascended the throne the palace was redecorated to reflect his own taste.</p>

A wide range of activities are offered at Olonana and you can plan your day to be as active or as leisurely as you wish. Visit the adjacent Maasai village, take a morning bush walk with an armed ranger or enjoy sundowners in the evening or even dinner under the stars in the middle of the African bush.<br /><br />In the Mara, the wildlife is abundant and the swaying grasslands ensure that animals are never out of sight. Elephants browse amongst the large herds of wildebeest, topi, gazelle, eland and buffalo. The plains offer a rich variety of food for the dominant predators: lion, leopard, hyena and cheetah. In the Mara River, hippos submerge while crocodiles sunbathe on the riverbanks.<br /><br />Around July to September, rain depending, the Masai Mara is host to the famous wildebeest migration which is one of the few remaining mass migrations of mammals in the world. During this time herds of over a million wildebeest will trawl their way through this region and they become the major focus for predatory activity and drama unfolds at every corner.<br /><br />There are also options for a morning balloon safari or a half-day visit to Lake Victoria.<br /><br />Balloon Safari: As the balloon is inflated against the first rays of sunrise your pilot will go through safety procedures. Once aloft, the balloon floats gently over the plains, giving a bird's eye view of the game below as the sun creeps slowly over the horizon. After around one hour the balloon lands as breakfast is already being prepared and, of course, enjoy a glass or two of bubbly to toast your flight in a tradition initiated by the Montgolfier brothers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lake Victoria Adventure : An early start this morning with a transfer to the airstrip for a flight by light aircraft to Lake Victoria. On arrival enjoy an appetising full English breakfast before you board the boat for the morning. There will be the opportunity to try fishing for the legendary giant Nile perch found in these waters as you explore the myriad of tiny islands in this region of the lake. An experienced and knowledgeable fisherman captains each boat. There is the chance to stop at a traditional fishing village and see how the villagers live from day to day before returning to the airstrip for your return flight to the Masai Mara.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p>";

<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>MOSCOW - SERGEIV POSAD - ROSTOV - YAROSLAVL</h5>
<p>Early this morning you leave Moscow behind as you venture into the countryside with your private vehicle and English-speaking guide to Yaroslavl.  En route you will stop in Sergiev Posad, still commonly referred by its Soviet name of 'Zagorsk'.  This is one of Russia's most important religious and historical landmarks.  You will visit the Trinity Monastery of St Sergius and its opulent treasury.  For 500 years, this was the most important place of pilgrimage in Russia. Continue to Rostov the Great. Rostov the Great was first mentioned in the ancient chronicles in the year 862 and its 17th century Kremlin is a pearl of Russian architecture.

<h5>KOSTROMA - SUZDAL</h5>
<p>
Start your morning with a sightseeing tour in Kostroma.  Kostroma is a historic city in central Russia located on the left bank of the Volga River. First mentioned in chronicles in 1237, Kostroma was founded somewhat earlier by pagan Slavs. In the 17th century young Michael Romanov accepted the Russian throne from his place of hiding in Kostroma's Ipatievsky monastery. It is understandable why the Romanov Tsars regarded Kostroma as their special protectorate. The Ipatievsky monastery was visited by many of them, including Nicholas II, the last Russian Tsar. The monastery had been founded in the early 14th century by a Tatar prince, ancestor of the Godunov family. Another popular destination in Kostroma is the open-air Museum of Wooden Architecture. Here amidst picturesque streams and woods stands a variety of hand crafted wooden structures from around the Kostroma region. Small churches, barns, windmills, boathouses, and a series of peasant dwellings ranging from the modest to the opulent are open for your inspection. After lunch at leisure continue to Suzdal where you stay for overnight.</p>

<p>
After lunch at leisure continue to Vladimir, stoping en route in Bogolubovo. Vladimir was founded by Vladimir Monamakh, Grand Prince of Kiev, in 1108 as a fort in the Rostov-Suzdal municipality. The most significant building made during his reign is the stunning 12th century Cathedral of the Assumption which houses frescoes by the greatest of old Russian painters, Andrei Rubylov.

Whether this is your first time on safari or a return trip the Serengeti will not disappoint.<br /><br />The Serengeti National Park is arguably the most famous national park in the world. The Serengeti perhaps defines the safari experience as surely as the wildlife that inhabits it. Established in 1951, and covering an area of almost 15,000 sq km, an area comparable to the state of Connecticut or Northern Ireland, the Serengeti hosts a fantastically diverse ecosystem. The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, where 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other plains game that follow close behind, make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";

The Selous supports around one million game animals, is bigger than Switzerland and is a World Heritage site.

Transfer from Arusha to Ngorongoro Crater Lodge located on the rim with spectacular views across the crater. The Ngorongoro Crater is the largest unbroken caldera in the world and the first sight of it is breathtaking.<br /><br />Ngorongoro Crater Lodge is situated on the edge of the ancient crater rim above the cool, swirling mists. The lodge is a return to the noble elegance of the travelling colonials. Inspired in design by the Maasai Manyatta, three separate camps of 6 to 12 suites each remember a bygone era when characters such as Lord Delamere adorned the stilted, handcrafted structures with graceful antiques, grand chandeliers and treasures collected from travels through Africa.<br /><br /></p>";

Rhinos can often be seen with calves at heel. Eland and waterbuck appear not to notice the human visitors, enabling photographers to shoot at ease. On the lake in the middle of the crater you may see thousands of flamingos fluttering and shimmering like a pink heat haze. Zebra and wildebeest account for almost half the animals.
