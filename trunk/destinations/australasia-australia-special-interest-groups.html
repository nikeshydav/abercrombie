</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>ARRIVE PERTH</h5>
<p>Meet your guide for a private sightseeing tour including a Swan River cruise.</p>
<p>
The Swan River is Perth's natural heartbeat - the city's location right on the river banks makes the capital one of the most beautiful in the world. The view of the river and city from Kings Park is among Western Australia's most scenic - city sky scrapers shining against a brilliant blue Perth sky, green parklands and the shimmering blue river combine to create a stunning vista.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> The Richardson Hotel, Deluxe Room</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>PERTH - CAPE RANGE NATIONAL PARK</h5>
<p>This morning fly to Exmouth then board a charter plane for 20 minute scenic flight over the impressive limestone plateaus of Cape Range National Park.  Hidden in the dunes discover Sal Salis with just eight eco wilderness tents complete with surprisingly luxurious comforts.  All meals, beverages and guided activities are included and an underwater garden lies just metres from the pristine white sand.  Sunset drinks and dinner are served with views to the reef.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Sal Salis, Wilderness Tent<br />
<strong>Meal Plan: </strong>B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>NINGALOO REEF: SWIM WITH THE WHALE SHARKS</h5>
<p>
Embark on an adventurous Whale Shark cruise aboard a luxurious vessel. Snorkel Ningaloo Reef and relax with a gourmet lunch on board.</p>
<p>
The Whale Shark is the largest member of the shark family, the largest fish in the world and suprisingly, a harmless plankton eater! Reported to reach 18 metres in length, the whale shark is easily identified by its pattern of white spots. Thought to mainly inhabit worldwide temperate and tropical seas, it is rarely seen in shallow coastal water, but is a daily visitor to the Ningaloo Reef between late March and July. Up to 12 Whale Sharks have been spotted close to the reef feeding (Whale Shark tours operate March - July). Manta Rays with wingspans several metres wide, as well as a variety of tropical fish and turtles can be seen year round.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Sal Salis, Wilderness Tent<br />
<strong>Meal Plan: </strong>B,L,D </p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>CORAL BAY</h5>
<p>
Collect your vehicle in Exmouth and drive to Coral Bay, the southern gateway of Ningaloo Reef. Board a one hour Sub-Sea explorer tour before riding a quad bike along the stunning coastline.</p>
<p>
Coral Bay is as idyllic as the name suggests. With a sweeping bay, bobbing yachts and the world-class Ningaloo Reef just two steps off the beach two nights in this destination is divine.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Ningaloo Reef Resort, Ocean Apartment<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B </p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>CORAL BAY</h5>
<p>
Renowned for its marine life, today's three hour cruise on Coral Bay invites dolphins, dugongs, manta rays, turtles and an array of fish sightings.</p>

<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>

Delight in the over 10,000 species and 50,000 individual plants in the 38 hectare gardens, including trees and plants of great cultural value. Many of these plants are irreplaceable, endangered or even extinct in the wild and have become a natural sanctuary for native wild life including black swans, bell birds, cockatoos and kookaburras that fill the air with their distinctive song.</p>
<p>

<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>Melbourne - Kangaroo Island</h5>
<p>After breakfast this morning meet your chauffeur in the hotel lobby and transfer by private vehicle to the Melbourne Domestic Airport. Depart Melbourne for Kangaroo Island (via Adelaide).</p>
<p>
Kangaroo Island is the place where you can quietly 'go bush' and see native Australian animals and birds as they were meant to be seen in the wild. Half the native bushland on Kangaroo Island remains just as it was when British navigator Matthew Flinders put a name to this untamed wilderness in 1802. And more than one-third of the Island is National or Conservation Park. Kangaroo Island is a true wildlife sanctuary. Owing to its isolation from the mainland, the Island has suffered less from the impact of European settlement and retains more than half of its native 'old-growth' vegetation - a vast area of some 2,250 square kilometres. The Island has been spared the damage done by foxes and rabbits, ensuring the integrity of native bushland and animal and bird populations have thrived. Kangaroo Island's prolific wildlife includes penguins, Australian sea lions, New Zealand fur seals, varied birdlife, koalas and echidnas, all revelling in the protected environs.</p>
<p>
On arrival in Kangaroo Island you will be transferred to your accommodation at Southern Ocean Lodge. Southern Ocean Lodge is Kangaroo Island's only world-class wilderness lodge.

<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Southern Ocean Lodge</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>Kangaroo Island - Adelaide - Uluru</h5>
<p>This morning depart Kangaroo Island for Uluru (Ayers Rock) via Adelaide.</p>
<p>
On arrival into Uluru you will be met by a representative of Longitude 131 and transferred to your accommodation.</p>
<p>
The new 'safari' style luxury tented site is the first of its kind in Australia. Built on the very edge of Uluru Kata Tjuta National Park, the fifteen individual tents have uninterrupted views over Uluru. Relax in the free-form swimming pool and enjoy an aperitif on the balcony as the sunsets over the desert, or simply lie in bed and watch the stars rise over the outback. Inside the tent, the atmosphere is lavish with expansive stone floors, beautiful bed linen and unique bathrooms and air conditioning.</p>
<p>
This is a special place where you will connect with the desert landscape and its magnificent natural wonders. At the Dune House enjoy a quiet drink, good food and the company of newfound friends.</p>
<p>
Uluru is a giant red monolith that has come to represent Australia itself. The massive sandstone rock - the summit of a buried mountain - generates an almost mystical power. The Rock is 8.8 kilometres around the base, 3.6 kilometres long, 2.4 kilometres wide and towers 348 metres above the surrounding plain. The Anangu people believe they are the direct descendents of the ancestral spirits who gave them the laws and rules that they live by. They believe they are responsible for the protection of the lands and ask visitors to respect their wishes not to climb the rock. Its significant power can be felt particularly in the early morning or at sunset as the Rock undergoes an extraordinary transformation of colour.</p>
<p>This afternoon is at your leisure at Longitude 131. You will have the opportunity to select your touring in the Red Centre upon check-in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>Uluru</h5>
<p>This morning, you may choose to enjoy an exclusive walking tour of the local bushland.  An interpretive guide will accompany you, explaining in great detail the dynamic ecology that exists in this harsh environment.  Guests will learn what food sources exist around them, which plants can be used for medicinal purposes, how to find tracks left by the movements of nocturnal fauna, and where to look to spot daytime fauna such as the local bird-life (using spotting binoculars). Each guest is encouraged to identify the many different plants, tracks and wildlife as they smell, touch and taste their bush surroundings.</p>
<p>
To climb the world's largest monolith is against the wishes of the traditional owners, the Anangu, because the path you would otherwise follow is the traditional route taken by their ancestral Mala (rufus hare-wallaby men) on their arrival at this scared place. A base walk will, however, offer you a deeply personal, moving and lasting experience.</p>
<p>
Departing Longitude 131° mid-afternoon, this tour travels into the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park Cultural Centre, a vibrant and engaging place of learning with more than a few surprises (don't miss the bulging folder of letters from previous visitors apologising for souveniring pieces of rock - the tales of regret and 'mysterious ill fortune' are fascinating).</p>
<p>
With a greater understanding of one of the world's truly ancient cultures, guests drive around Uluru and see for themselves the sites, which are so sacred to the traditional owners. A walk into the Mutitjulu waterhole offers each guest a unique insight into the sheer physical and spiritual enormity of Uluru. During the walk, the guide will point out cave paintings and other relevant sites important to Anangu and the early explorers.</p>
<p>
You will be returned to Longitude 131° to freshen up before enjoying sunset champagne and canapés atop our secluded sand dune with stunning 360° views of Uluru and Kata Tjuta.</p>
<p>
From there, you will be taken to an exclusive desert setting where dinner will be served under a glittering canopy of stars. A resident astronomer will join you to explain how our sun, earth and galaxy interact, the almost unfathomable distances involved in space travel, and how our ancestors navigated land and sea on countless voyages of discovery. Guests are regaled with tales of the southern night sky and famous constellations such as the signs of the zodiac, Seven Sisters, Southern Cross and Orion's Belt. </p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Longitude 131°</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 8</h4>
<h5>Uluru - Cairns - Mossman</h5>
<p> This morning a representative of Longitude 131 will meet you and transfer you to Ayers Rock Airport for your flight to Cairns.</p>
<p>
On arrival into Cairns you will be met by your guide and transferred by private vehicle to your accommodation, a stunning one hour drive along some of Australia's most scenic coastline.</p>
<p>
Silky Oaks Lodge is situated on the banks of the Mossman River, at the gateway to the World Heritage listed Daintree Rainforest.  Each private cabin is appointed with handcrafted Australian colonial timber furniture and has its own private veranda overlooking billabongs (waterholes) or rock swimming pools. Tropical breakfast makes a fresh start to your day and optional activities available include spa and massage treatments, freshwater swimming, tennis, bike riding and guided walks through the rainforest during the day and evening to see kangaroos, birds and platypus.</p>
<p>
The remainder of the day is at leisure to relax in tropical surroundings.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Silky Oaks Lodge</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 9</h4>
<h5>Mossman</h5>
<p>After breakfast depart on a private 4WD safari of World Heritage listed Cape Tribulation and the Daintree Rainforest. The area comprises nearly 900,000 hectares of rainforest and has existed in its present state for many thousands of years. Explore the area with an expert naturalist guide whose diverse knowledge of botany, ornithology and zoology will help unlock the secrets of the rainforest. Cruise on the Daintree River and after lunch in a local restaurant enjoy a guided walk through the rainforest to discover a myriad of bizarre and fascinating plants and animals.</p>
<p>
During your tour to Cape Tribulation today you will spend an hour with Rainforest Rescue, a philanthropic organisation. Meet a representative who will provide a detailed presentation covering the Daintree Rainforest, its globally valued biodiversity and the importance of saving and planting rainforests. Next participate in planting a tree and learn about the species and the correct way to plant the tree to maximise its chance of survival. </p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Silky Oaks Lodge</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 10</h4>
<h5>Mossman - Cairns - Lizard Island</h5>
<p>This morning visit a private ethno-botanical garden in the heart of the Daintree Rainforest. Located at the end of a jungle-clad valley, the Botanical Ark is in a remote location. Enjoy an interpretive garden tour with the founder of this tropical oasis, Alan Carle. Be inspired as you learn about the intrinsic link between rainforest plants and cultures and sample some of the most unusual and interesting tastes and sights imaginable. Relax and unwind on the veranda of this truly beautiful Queensland home as you are served morning or afternoon tea with a very exotic fruit tasting. Following your visit, transfer by private vehicle to the Cairns General Aviation Airport. Depart Cairns for Lizard Island in a private twin-engine light aircraft charter flight.</p>
<p>
Imagine an island so pristine, so untouched, that when you walk on any one of the 24 secluded beaches there are no other footprints. Lizard Island is the most northerly island resort located directly on the Great Barrier Reef.</p>

Visit the adjacent Maasai village, take a morning bush walk with an armed ranger or enjoy sundowners in the evening or even dinner under the stars in the middle of the African bush.<br /><br />In the Mara, the wildlife is abundant and the swaying grasslands ensure that animals are never out of sight. Elephants browse amongst the large herds of wildebeest, topi, gazelle, eland and buffalo. The plains offer a rich variety of food for the dominant predators: lion, leopard, hyena and cheetah. In the Mara River, hippos submerge while crocodiles sunbathe on the riverbanks.<br /><br />Around July to September, rain depending, the Masai Mara is host to the famous wildebeest migration which is one of the few remaining mass migrations of mammals in the world. During this time herds of over a million wildebeest will trawl their way through this region and they become the major focus for predatory activity and drama unfolds at every corner.<br /><br />There are also options for a morning balloon safari or a half-day visit to Lake Victoria.<br /><br />Balloon Safari: As the balloon is inflated against the first rays of sunrise your pilot will go through safety procedures. Once aloft, the balloon floats gently over the plains, giving a bird's eye view of the game below as the sun creeps slowly over the horizon. After around one hour the balloon lands as breakfast is already being prepared and, of course, enjoy a glass or two of bubbly to toast your flight in a tradition initiated by the Montgolfier brothers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lake Victoria Adventure : An early start this morning with a transfer to the airstrip for a flight by light aircraft to Lake Victoria. On arrival enjoy an appetising full English breakfast before you board the boat for the morning. There will be the opportunity to try fishing for the legendary giant Nile perch found in these waters as you explore the myriad of tiny islands in this region of the lake. An experienced and knowledgeable fisherman captains each boat. There is the chance to stop at a traditional fishing village and see how the villagers live from day to day before returning to the airstrip for your return flight to the Masai Mara.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p>";
