<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong>  9 days </p>
<p>A 9-day itinerary taking in the highlights of the Republic of Ireland, beginning in and ending in Dublin.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong> Dublin, Wicklow, Powerscourt, Glendalough, Cashel, Cork, Kerry, Cliffs of Moher, Galway, Connemara</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>Arrive Dublin</h5>
<p>Upon arrival at Dublin airport you will be met in the arrivals hall by your local representative and privately transferred to your hotel. Your representative will assist you with check-in procedures.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Merrion Hotel</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Dublin</h5>
<p>This morning, join an expert Dublin city guide for a panoramic tour of the Irish capital. On the tour, see Leinster House where the Irish government is based, the Presidential Palace in Phoenix Park, Dublin Castle, St. Patrick's Cathedral, grandiose O'Connell Street, and the elegant Georgian squares that are so symbolic of the city. Stop at Trinity College where the Old Library houses the beautiful Book of Kells, arguably the finest 8th century manuscript that has survived.</p>
<p>
Visit Trinity College, founded in 1592 by Queen Elizabeth 1 on the site of an Augustinian monastery. Originally a Protestant College, it was not until the 1970's that Catholics started entering the university. Among the many famous students to attend the college were playwrights Oliver Goldsmith and Samuel Beckett, Oscar Wilde, Bram Stoker (creator of the novel Dracula), Jonathan Swift and political writer Edmund Burke. Trinity's lawns and cobbled quads provide a pleasant haven in the heart of the city. Trinity houses the Book of Kells in the Old Library with its superb barrel-vaulted ceiling.  The most richly decorated of Ireland's medieval illuminated manuscripts, the Book of Kells may have been the work of monks from Iona, who fled to Kells in 806 AD after a Viking raid. The book, which was moved to Trinity College in the 17th century, contains the four gospels in Latin.  The scribes who copied the texts also embellished their calligraphy with intricate interlacing spirals as well as human figures and animals. Some of the dyes used were imported from as far as the Middle East.  </p>
<p>
This afternoon you have two choices:</p>
<p>
Option 1<br />
Visit the National Museum of Ireland. In the Treasury see some of the finest examples of medieval Celtic metalwork, including the Tara Brooch and the Ardagh Chalice. Walk round to the National Gallery of Ireland that houses a fine collection of Irish paintings dating from the 17th to the 20th century among its fine old master collections.</p>
<p>
Option 2<br />
Step back in history and visit the shrine of Irish Independence - Kilmainham Gaol. Between 1796 and 1924 Kilmainham Gaol housed many political prisoners, the last being Eamon De Valera, later to become Taoiseach (Prime Minister) and then President of Ireland who was released from the jail on July 16 1924. It was here that the ringleaders of the 1916 Easter Rising, including Patrick Pearse and James Connolly were shot by firing squad in the stone breaking yard. The jail is now a museum, restored to its original grim condition with dark passages, punishment cells and an execution yard.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Merrion Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>The Wicklow Mountains</h5>
<p>Meet your driver-guide to enjoy a full day excursion into the Wicklow Mountains that lie to the south of Dublin.</p>
<p>
The avenue of Powerscourt leading to the Palladian house echoes the magnificence of the whole estate, being a mile long and lined by over 2,000 beech trees. In addition, the 47 acres of gardens are remarkable for their grandeur of scale whilst combining great delicacy and refinement of detail. The charming walled garden, the striking terraces, fine statuary and varied trees are linked by carefully designed walks and set in the magnificent surroundings of the Wicklow Mountains. The house was gutted by a fire in 1974 but has recently been reborn. An exhibition brings to life the rich history of the estate, which is now home to the best of Irish design in gifts, clothes, and furniture in the Avoca Stores and the interiors Gallery.</p>
<p>
From Powerscourt, continue on to Glendalough, known as the Valley of the Two Lakes. Glendalough is one of Ireland's national monuments - for scenic, religious, historic and archaeological reasons. Traveling through the Wicklow Gap is like entering an Irish Shangri-La, so shrouded is it in beauty, mystery and tranquillity. In the distance, the Wicklow Mountains fold gracefully into one another. The mountain forests of pine and spruce are reflected in the clear waters of the two lakes that give the valley its name.</p>
<p>
Glendalough was a place of religious pilgrimage for centuries following its establishment as a monastic centre by St. Kevin in the 6th century. By the 12th century it was an important diocese. However Viking raids did Glendalough much damage and, after a great fire in 1398, it declined as a religious centre. The tour will take you through the remains of the main monastic complex, through the remarkably well-preserved St. Kevin's Church and the imposing 100ft high Round Tower.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Merrion Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>Dublin - Rock of Cashel - County Kerry</h5>
<p>Enjoy a full day of touring with your driver-guide as you travel through rich pasturelands. The inland countryside route passes into County Tipperary, home to the Rock of Cashel that dramatically overshadows the town below. The ruined 13th Century cathedral and the round tower perch dramatically on top of this outcrop.</p>
<p>
From here you can choose to visit either the town of Cobh or Blarney Castle.</p>
<p>
Option 1<br />
Blarney Castle is a small ruined tower house that dates back to the 15th century and has become a national icon as the home of the Blarney Stone. This stone, rumoured to have been brought to Ireland in the time of the crusades, is embedded in the parapet of the castle, and is said to bestow the 'gift of the gab' on all those who kiss it. The castle is situated in beautiful grounds which are adjacent to the Blarney Woolen Mills complex, one of the largest retail outlets in Ireland where fine local goods can be purchased. Please note: the climb up Blarney Castle is difficult, and is not recommended for those who have difficulty with stairs.</p>
<p>
Option 2<br />
Steep narrow streets climb the hill above Cobh's fine natural harbour giving wide views across the bay. Its name, pronounced 'cove' is simply the Irish for 'haven'. Now a popular resort and yachting centre, Cobh was the headquarters of the Royal Yacht Club, founded in 1720 and the oldest such club in the world. Cobh was once the main departure point for emigrants to America and was a stopping place for transatlantic liners. The Sirius sailed from Cobh in 1838 to make the first ever Atlantic steamer crossing and the doomed Titanic called there in 1912. Towering over Cobh is the magnificent Gothic-style cathedral which was built in 1868, faced with blue granite and supported inside by pillars made from local marble topped with intricately carved capitals. Its carillon of 42 bells is claimed to be the largest in Ireland.</p>
<p>On to Killarney with its spectacular scenery, unusually mild climate and rapid changes in light and weather, this is a bewitching place of intense beauty. Ireland's highest mountains, Macgillycuddy Reeks, raise a jagged edge to the sky while at their feet rest three still lakes, studded with little islands, set among forests and lush glens thick with grand trees, wild fuchsias and scented orchids.   </p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Sheen Falls Lodge</br>
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>Ring of Kerry</h5>
<p>Today tour one of the best-loved coastal drives in Europe with your driver-guide on a full day excursion (8 hours) around the Ring of Kerry. The road follows the shoreline of the Iveragh Peninsula, passing some of the most beautiful mountain and moorland scenery in the whole of Ireland. Between the mountains and coast, this route passes by many land and seascapes and you will gain fabulous views over the bays to the neighbouring Dingle and Beara peninsulas. En-route pass Derrynane House, the home of Daniel O'Connell, the 'Great Liberator' of Ireland.</p>
<p>
In the midst of Killarney National Park stands Muckross House, set in the shadow of Macgillycuddy's Reeks, the highest mountains in Ireland. You can explore its lovely gardens and traditional farms which recreate farming methods that were used back in the 1930s. Between April and July, the gardens are even more attractive as they are beautifully embellished in red and pink flowers of Rhododendrons. Return to your hotel from here.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Sheen Falls Lodge / Killarney Park<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>County Kerry - County Clare - Cong</h5>
<p>
Depart Kerry with your driver-guide for a full day excursion. You can choose here whether to visit the Cliffs of Moher, or whether to visit the village of Adare, Limerick and Bunratty Castle.</p>
<p>
Option 1<br />
Reach the towering Cliffs of Moher; at over 600 feet tall these sandstone cliffs are Ireland's highest. They are exposed to the fiercest of Atlantic storms and large colonies of cliff nesting seabirds birds can be spotted here. From the Cliffs one can see the Aran Islands and Galway Bay. Continuing on from the cliffs, drive through The Burren, an area of limestone rock covering the majestic mountains and tranquil valleys with gently meandering streams. The coast road will then take you around Galway Bay, famed for its oysters. Time permitting, you may wish to stop in Galway the lively and picturesque city with an avant-garde culture. Continuing past Galway City you will enter Connemara, the Irish Lake District, where your hotel is located.</p>
<p>
Option 2<br />
Explore the picturesque village of Adare, well known for its thatched cottages and medieval ruins. Cross the River Shannon at Limerick into County Clare. At Bunratty Castle, you can see the largest 15th century tower house in Ireland, in the grounds of which are a series of traditional thatched cottages that have been carefully reconstructed.</p>
<p>Continue past Galway City to your hotel that enjoys a delightful setting overlooking a bay.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Ashford Castle<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>Connemara</h5>
<p>Enjoy a full day with your driver-guide to explore the windswept landscape of Connemara where barren mountains surround small lakes. The Connemara coast is wrapped around the Twelve Pins and, jutting out into the Atlantic, is a landscape of wild, rocky bog land and of ragged coastline coloured with the autumnal shades of seaweed and pine trees on tiny pincushion islands mirrored in the Loughs. On the shores of one such lake sits Kylemore Abbey, still home to a living community of nuns. The walled garden in the grounds of the abbey has been faithfully restored to its former glory.</p>
<p> 
Drive north past Killary Harbour, Ireland's only fjord, into County Mayo, where you will pass the holy mountain of Croagh Patrick to which there is an annual pilgrimage each year. Return to your hotel from here.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Ashford Castle<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 8</h4>
<h5>West Connaught - Strokestown - Kildare</h5>
<p>
For your final full day of touring, your driver-guide will take you back towards Dublin. Visit Galway City and either Castletown House or  Strokestown House. In Galway you can have time at leisure to explore the quaint city perched on the edge of the bay.</p>
<p>
Option 1<br />
Continuing your journey, stop at Strokestown Park, where you can visit the Irish Famine Museum, dedicated to the victims of the potato blight in the 19th century.</p>
 <p>
Option 2<br />
Visit Castletown House, Ireland's largest and earliest Palladian style house. It is very important in terms of European architectural heritage; famous for its stucco work and elaborate Baroque style.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> K-Club<br />

</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>Arrive Scotland - Transfer to Gleneagles</h5>

</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Stirlingshire and the Trossachs</h5>
<p> Today you will be joined by a driver-guide who will take you on a full day excursion into the Stirlingshire countryside to the southwest of Gleneagles. Start by visit Stirling Castle that sits atop a rocky outcrop surveying the countryside that was the venue for two famous battles where the armies of William Wallace and Robert the Bruce defeated the invading England forces. It was in the Chapel Royal of the castle that the infant Mary was crowned Queen of Scots in 1543.</p>
<p>
  This afternoon, you may want to take a traditional tour Scottish scenery. If so, drive into the Trossachs, a beautiful area of mountains, forests and lakes often known as Rob Roy country after an infamous outlaw. In the middle of the region is Loch Katrine, where you can take a boat trip on the SS Sir Walter Scott, a historic steamship.</p>
<p>
 If you prefer something a little more contemporary, travel to Falkirk which is an industrial town on the junction of two of Scotland's canals which run at very different levels. In order to connect them more efficiently, the Falkirk Wheel was constructed as part of the Millennium celebrations. This enormous structure is the world's finest rotating boat lift; take a short cruise on a barge to experience the wheel in motion.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Gleneagles Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>
<li>

You may also wish to visit the nearby Treasury of the National Museum, where the finest examples of medieval Celtic metalwork are on display, or the National Gallery that houses a fine collection of paintings.</p>
<p>
Later, if history is your passion you could choose to visit St. Patrick's Cathedral, the largest church in Ireland, and tour the staterooms of Dublin Castle, longtime symbol of British rule in Ireland. If however you prefer something more unusual, why not join a tour of the city by 'Duck', a WWII amphibious vehicle from which you will see the major city landmarks from both land and water!</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Ritz-Carlton Powerscourt Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan: </strong>B</p>
</li>
<li>

Drive across the bleak moorlands to Glendalough, the 'Valley of the Two Lakes', where St. Kevin established a monastic community during the Dark Ages. At this evocative and haunting site, it is possible to imagine life in these earlier times as you wander through the ruins of the churches, and past perfectly preserved round tower.</p>
<p>
 Also in this area is the village of Avoca that served as the location for 'Ballykissangel' on TV. It is home to the renowned Avoca Handweavers, the finest manufacturers of quality woolen fashions in Ireland.</p>
<p>

Visit the adjacent Maasai village, take a morning bush walk with an armed ranger or enjoy sundowners in the evening or even dinner under the stars in the middle of the African bush.<br /><br />In the Mara, the wildlife is abundant and the swaying grasslands ensure that animals are never out of sight. Elephants browse amongst the large herds of wildebeest, topi, gazelle, eland and buffalo. The plains offer a rich variety of food for the dominant predators: lion, leopard, hyena and cheetah. In the Mara River, hippos submerge while crocodiles sunbathe on the riverbanks.<br /><br />Around July to September, rain depending, the Masai Mara is host to the famous wildebeest migration which is one of the few remaining mass migrations of mammals in the world. During this time herds of over a million wildebeest will trawl their way through this region and they become the major focus for predatory activity and drama unfolds at every corner.<br /><br />There are also options for a morning balloon safari or a half-day visit to Lake Victoria.<br /><br />Balloon Safari: As the balloon is inflated against the first rays of sunrise your pilot will go through safety procedures. Once aloft, the balloon floats gently over the plains, giving a bird's eye view of the game below as the sun creeps slowly over the horizon. After around one hour the balloon lands as breakfast is already being prepared and, of course, enjoy a glass or two of bubbly to toast your flight in a tradition initiated by the Montgolfier brothers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lake Victoria Adventure : An early start this morning with a transfer to the airstrip for a flight by light aircraft to Lake Victoria. On arrival enjoy an appetising full English breakfast before you board the boat for the morning. There will be the opportunity to try fishing for the legendary giant Nile perch found in these waters as you explore the myriad of tiny islands in this region of the lake. An experienced and knowledgeable fisherman captains each boat. There is the chance to stop at a traditional fishing village and see how the villagers live from day to day before returning to the airstrip for your return flight to the Masai Mara.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p>";

<p> Today is dedicated to activity. This morning, you will join one of the estate's Rangers for a guided three hour walk exploring the estate's nature reserve. The estate is made up of 23,000 glorious acres of Scottish wilderness at the narrowest point of the British Isles. From the highest point it is possible to see both the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea. As well as enjoying the spectacular scenery and fresh air of the Highlands, you will learn from the Ranger about the pioneering work of the estate which aims to restore much of the native forest and the wildlife, such as wild boar, which is once again starting to roam freely in it's natural habitat. Your visit to the estate will contribute directly to this conservation project.</p>
<p>
After returning to the Lodge for lunch, you will have an afternoon free to explore the landscape by mountain bike.</p>
<p>
Upon return to the Lodge, it is time to unwind and enjoy a game of snooker in the Games Room or rest your aching limbs in the Lodge's sauna. Spa treatments may be booked on request (not included and advance booking recommended).</p>

<h5>WILDERNESS &AMP; WILDLIFE EXPERIENCE BY 4 X 4</h5>
<p> Today is dedicated to natural wildlife as you take a 4 x 4 Wilderness and Wildlife Experience tour with a Ranger. The estate's flora and fauna is a unique experience which includes the remnants of the 'Great Wood of Caledon' which covered much of Caledonia during Roman times. Birdlife at the estate is exceptional and include golden eagle, osprey, peregrine falcon and the merlin. We recommend you bring binoculars to truly appreciate the wildlife opportunities.</p>
<p>
Other wildlife includes the notoriously shy badger, which may be observed in a their hide. It may also be possible to spot deer, elk, Highland cattle, pine martin, red fox, and otter. Red squirrels, which have become almost extinct in the British Isles are currently being reintroduced on the estate and so keep your eyes peeled. One of the estate's conservation projects includes a study on wild boar, supervised by Oxford University's Wildlife Conservation Research Unit. Your Ranger will detail these projects to you first hand.</p>
<p>
Return to the Lodge for an ample lunch and then venture out for an afternoon with your choice of either trout fly fishing (1 April  -30 September) or to observe salmon leaping (seasonal). A selection of Orvis fishing rods and tackle are available at the Lodge for use during your stay.</p>

<strong>Overnight:</strong> The Lodge<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>OPTIONAL CLAY BIRD SHOOTING, PONY TREKKING OR EXCURSION</h5>
<p>Today you may choose simply to relax at the Lodge or explore the eastate further.</p>
<p>
Alternatively you may like to take advantage of one of optional activities such as clay bird shooting or pony trekking through the lochs and glens of the estate. There are pony tracks throughout the estate and your guide will inform you of the points of interest along the way, such as the ruins of old crofts left as silent evidence of the infamous Highland Clearances.</p>
<p>
For those wishing to explore the Highlands further there are a range of places to visit within driving distance. On the east coast, Dornoch is a quaint historic town that is home to a small cathedral church that was the venue for the wedding of Madonna and Guy Richie. Dornoch is also home to the most northerly of Scotland's great links golf courses, the Royal Dornoch.</p>
<p>
 To the north of here lies Dunrobin Castle, home of Lord Strathnaver. Built in a fairytale French style, this castle is one of the most unusual in appearance in Scotland; it has many richly furnished rooms to explore, and overlooks an extensive park. In the opposite direction in Tain is the Glenmorangie Distillery where many people's favorite brand of malt whisky is produced; distillery tours and tastings are available on all weekdays, and weekends during the Summer.</p>
<p>
Heading west through the mountains, you are treated to some of the finest scenery that Scotland has to offer. The mountains of this region present a bleak, glacially eroded landscape where it is possible to imagine the warfare that took place between the Highland clans in bygone eras. People stopping at the striking Falls of Shin may be able to see salmon attempting their great leap over the cascade in order to get upstream. Those who continue further west into the Assynt region see some famous mountains like Suilven and Quinag before reaching the Atlantic Coast. Lochinver and Ullapool are two attractive small towns that have excellent views over the ocean and the surrounding coastal hills.
</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> The Lodge<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>HIGHLANDS - GLENEAGLES VIA LOCH NESS, BEN NEVIS AND GLENCOE</h5>
<p> Today you will see some of Scotland's best-known places on a full day journey to Gleneagles with your guide and private vehicle.  Leave Alladale and drive south to Inverness, the 'capital' of the Scottish Highlands, along the River Ness until you reach Loch Ness, home of the fabled monster. You will visit the ruins of Urquhart Castle that dominate the deepest part of the lake, and from where the monster has been seen more often than from any other place!</p>
<p>
Continue along the Great Glen past Ben Nevis, the highest mountain in Scotland, to Fort William that stands at the head of Loch Linnhe. Your route continues along Glencoe, scene of the infamous massacre of the MacDonalds by the Campbells. At the head of this valley, cross the wild and grandiose upland plain called Rannoch Moor. On reaching Crianlarich, turn east and head to Gleneagles Hotel.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Gleneagles<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 8</h4>
<h5>THE TROSSACHS &AMP; ABERFOYLE</h5>

Drive through the woods and hills of the region to Loch Katrine, where you will take a scenic boat cruise on this lonely and picturesque stretch of water.</p>
<p>
Return to Gleneagles via Aberfoyle, once the home of the Scottish Wool Centre where various breeds of sheep are reared whose fleeces are used locally.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Gleneagles<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 9</h4>
<h5>GLENEAGLES AND OPTIONAL EXCURSION TO STIRLNG</h5>
<p> You may choose to spend a full day enjoying the excellent leisure facilities on the Gleneagles estate.</p>
<p>
For those seeking a more cultural experience, one possible excursion is to Stirling, where the castle is one of the most important historically in Scotland. The impressive Great Hall and the Chapel Royal dominate the plains around Stirling Bridge, where the 'Braveheart' William Wallace defeated the English army in 1297. To the south of Stirling, the Battlefield of Banockburn is where Robert the Bruce finally sent the English out from Scotland in 1314.</p>
<p>
Also near Gleneagles are the beautiful formal gardens of Drummond Castle where a guided tour with a horticulturalist can be arranged. If you think you have seen these gardens before, they were used as a main location in the film 'Rob Roy', based around the life of the notorious outlaw who lived in this area of central Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Gleneagles<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>

Serengeti is the home of the great wildebeest migration and the short grass plains around your accommodation provide the perfect setting for the wildebeest as they mass around the area during the birthing of their young in the early months of each year.<br /><br />Kusini is perfectly located in a private corner of the Serengeti and sited among a cluster of kopjes (beautiful outcrops of granite rock).&nbsp; Part of Kusini's charm is its remote and private location within the park borders and with no other camps in the near vicinity Kusini offers exceptional and essentially private game viewing.<br /></p>";

						description = description + "<p>The next two days are yours to enjoy game viewing as you venture out in open 4X4 vehicles led by your expert driver/guide. A wide range of activities are offered at Olonana and you can plan your day to be as active or as leisurely as you wish. Visit the adjacent Maasai village, take a morning bush walk with an armed ranger or enjoy sundowners in the evening or even dinner under the stars in the middle of the African bush.<br /><br />In the Mara, the wildlife is abundant and the swaying grasslands ensure that animals are never out of sight. Elephants browse amongst the large herds of wildebeest, topi, gazelle, eland and buffalo. The plains offer a rich variety of food for the dominant predators: lion, leopard, hyena and cheetah. In the Mara River, hippos submerge while crocodiles sunbathe on the riverbanks.<br /><br />Around July to September, rain depending, the Masai Mara is host to the famous wildebeest migration which is one of the few remaining mass migrations of mammals in the world. During this time herds of over a million wildebeest will trawl their way through this region and they become the major focus for predatory activity and drama unfolds at every corner.<br /><br />There are also options for a morning balloon safari or a half-day visit to Lake Victoria.<br /><br />Balloon Safari: As the balloon is inflated against the first rays of sunrise your pilot will go through safety procedures. Once aloft, the balloon floats gently over the plains, giving a bird's eye view of the game below as the sun creeps slowly over the horizon. After around one hour the balloon lands as breakfast is already being prepared and, of course, enjoy a glass or two of bubbly to toast your flight in a tradition initiated by the Montgolfier brothers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lake Victoria Adventure : An early start this morning with a transfer to the airstrip for a flight by light aircraft to Lake Victoria. On arrival enjoy an appetising full English breakfast before you board the boat for the morning. There will be the opportunity to try fishing for the legendary giant Nile perch found in these waters as you explore the myriad of tiny islands in this region of the lake. An experienced and knowledgeable fisherman captains each boat. There is the chance to stop at a traditional fishing village and see how the villagers live from day to day before returning to the airstrip for your return flight to the Masai Mara.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p>";
