<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong>  8 days</p>
<p>This itinerary is ideal for those seeking a remote bush experience coupled with great hospitality and spectacular opportunities to explore.</p>
<p>
<strong>Highlights:</strong> Johannesburg, Zambia, South Luangwa National Park and Zambezi River</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>Arrive in Zambia</h5>
<p>On arrival at Lusaka International Airport, a representative will meet you, hand over further documentation and assist you onto your Proflight
flight to Mfuwe. The flying time from Lusaka to Mfuwe is approximately 1 hour. </p>
<p>On arrival at Mfuwe Airport, a representative will meet and transfer you to Sanctuary Chichele Presidential Lodge. The road transfer time is
approximately 2 hours, subject to game viewing enroute.</p>
<p>This historic property, once the bush retreat of President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, has a magnificent hilltop location in Zambia's premier
game viewing area, the South Luangwa National Park. Carefully restored by Sanctuary Retreats to preserve its turn-of-the-century elegance,
Sanctuary Chichele Presidential Lodge is approached through a majestic arched entrance leading to a huge colonial-style lounge. Its long
terrace, with commanding views across the valleys of the South Luangwa, is the perfect place to enjoy breakfast or afternoon tea. Chichele has
ten air-conditioned suites, each with French doors onto individual balconies overlooking the valley. The lodge is accessible all year around and
the ideal base for exploring the prolific wildlife that populates the mosaic of different habitats surrounding the Luangwa River.</p>
<p>Game drives in the lodge's customized 4 x 4 vehicles by day or night, are an ideal way to explore the South Luangwa - an area famed for its
frequent leopard sightings. This is also an excellent area to spot lion, elephant, packs of wild dog and endemic species such as the Thornicroft
giraffe and Cookson's wildebeest.</p>
<p>
The remainder of the day is at leisure to enjoy the game viewing activities on offer.  The camp manager will advise details of all the activities available.</p>
<p>This part of Zambia is also renowned for being the original home of the walking safari. A stay at Chichele also offers the chance to venture out
on foot with a Zambian professional guide and qualified Park Ranger as guests learn about the bush from a different perspective, up close and
personal with the environment.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Sanctuary Chichele Presidential Lodge<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>South Luangwa National Park</h5>
<p>After an early morning game viewing activity, you will set off to Sanctuary Zebra Plains Walking Camp for your next adventure.</p>
<p>Sanctuary Zebra Plains is located in a beautiful and untouched area of the South Luangwa, perched on a sand bank at the confluence of the
Luangwa and Chibembe Rivers. There are just four traditional tents. The camp accommodates a maximum of six guests, allowing for an
intimate exploration of the South Luangwa. All tents have real beds, campaign furniture, mosquito nets, and en-suite facilities. Water for al
fresco showers is mixed to your preferred temperature by a tent attendant. The main mess tent has a dining area although most of the meals
will be served in the open in carefully selected vantage points. There is also a small library and bar area.</p>
<p>This seasonal camp will operate from June to October each year. The camp has been designed to leave the lowest possible carbon footprint
and will be packed up completely each year with no trace that it was ever there between seasons.</p>
<p>In order to fully explore the South Luangwa, guests will spend three nights at the camp with set departures on Monday or Thursday.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong>Sanctuary Zebra Plains Walking Camp<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>South Luangwa National Park</h5>
<p>Garth Hovell, a safari guide with almost twenty years of experience, will lead walks twice a day. There will be a morning and afternoon walk each
day. Garth will share with you some of the most fascinating, yet easily missed, sights and sounds of the bush.</p>
<p>One morning you might wander along a river bank, observing hippos before canoeing across to a large island across from camp to get up close
to plains game. Later that day you may choose to explore nearby Zebra Plains where buffalo, elephant and eland gather in large herds on the
open savannah, a rarity in the wooded terrain of the South Luangwa. Another day your destination might be the Changwa Channel, featured in
David Attenborough’s “Life” series and home to one of the largest hippo populations on earth.<br>
However it’s not just the big animals that are fascinating – termites, dung beetles, chameleons and the prolific bird life all have their stories to tell.</p>
<p>You will be also be accompanied by an armed games scout as well as a Sanctuary tea bearer who will make fresh cups of tea or coffee in the
middle of the bush using a stainless steel kettle and traditional fire making skills.</p>
<p><strong>Meal Plan:</strong>D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>Lower Zambezi National Park</h5>
<p>Today you will enjoy your last activity before departing for Mfuwe Airport for your flight to the Lower Zambezi.</p>
<p>On arrival at Jeki Airstrip, a representative will meet and transfer you to the camp.</p>
<p>Chiawa Camp is a must for any visit to Zambia. Superb accommodation, magnificent game viewing and scenery, and a large variety of activities
are complemented by a modern infrastructure and an attentive, professional staff. Resting peacefully on the river bank, in a grove of mahogany
and acacia trees, the lodge is constructed essentially of natural materials, and is designed to ensure its idyllic setting can be fully appreciated. 
All tents are under thatch, have en-suite facilities with hot & cold running water, twin or double beds, insect screens and solar powered lighting.</p>
<p>Guests can be accommodated in 8 well- appointed safari tents, each on a raised timber deck with private veranda. Access paths to the tents run
through a grove of Mahoganey trees behind them, maximizing privacy. The honeymoon suite has a beautiful private view of the Zambezi, the
escarpment and the Chiawa River bed. The tent is light and spacious and the en-suite facilities are to die for. Victorian bath, his and hers wash
basins and a shower for two all in wood and brass.</p>
<p>The spacious lounge and bar area has an observation platform built into its roof, providing one of the best views in the valley. Of course the
dining area also looks out onto the river and the animals which regularly come to drink and feed at and near the lodge. Enjoy barbeques under
the stars on our al-fresco dining veranda, while your hosts oversee your comfort and the preparation of Chiawa's renowned cuisine.</p>
<p>After dinner, retire to the campfire and enjoy a cocktail or two while taking in the sounds and magic of the African night.</p>
<p>Another viewing platform has been constructed in the quietest corner of the lodge, overlooking the confluence of the Chiawa & Zambezi rivers. 
Sip a cup of tea or a Pimm's while watching nature move at nature's pace and savour the tranquility of Real Africa.</p>

<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>Lower Zambezi National Park </h5>
<p>At Chiawa Camp it is all about the wildlife, the bush and the river, and an impressive variety of safari activities are available, led by our award
winning team of Africa-born guides with an unmatched fleet of vehicles, boats and canoes at their disposal - for all of which our safari operation
has become world-renowned.</p>
<p>This means that guests will enjoy levels of choice & convenience not found elsewhere and where the duration of a safari activity is determined
by the rhythm of the bush (& enthusiasm of our guests) rather than by the clock.</p>
<p>Not only that, your guides who are to differing extents products of our own in house training program, will guide sympathetically with the best
interests of the wildlife, the environment and you at heart meaning that you will get the very best out of your visit to the Lower Zambezi National
Park.</p>
<p>Safety is always a priority so all guides have recurrent Advanced first aid training and all boats and vehicles, canoe trips and walks carry first
comprehensive first aid kits and are linked to both camps by our VHF radio network.</p>
<p>This is the safest and most effective way to view big game. Drives are conducted in open 4wd vehicles that have been specially adapted for
safari use with comfy seats, pockets to stow your gear and bean bags to steady your camera for those all important photos. Usually departing in
the early morning, drives can last anywhere from 2 to 4 hours depending on what's seen and the requirements of the guests. In the late
afternoon drives set off for an hour or so before stopping at a scenic point for sundowners.</p>
<p>Pioneered in Zambia, bush walks are essentially a "micro-safari". An armed ranger with your qualified and experienced pro guide will guide you
through the wilderness on foot, interpreting spoor, identifying the various flora and fauna, and highlighting conservation issues. However
elephants and buffalo are seen on most walks and sometimes the big cats so expect anything at anytime. The pace is leisurely and the duration
is determined by guests' requirements – and what is seen on the walk. Typically, a few hours are sufficient.</p>
<p>One of the great aspects of a visit to Chiawa Camp is the variety of activities offered by virtue of our presence on the Zambezi river.</p>

You can visit the adjacent Maasai village, take a morning bush walk with an armed ranger or enjoy sundowners in the evening or even dinner under the stars in the middle of the African bush.<br /><br />In the Mara, the wildlife is abundant and the swaying grasslands ensure that animals are never out of sight. Elephants browse amongst the large herds of wildebeest and topi, gazelle, eland and buffalo. The plains offer a rich variety of food for the dominant predators: lion, leopard, hyena and cheetah. In the Mara River, hippos submerge to snort and grumble while crocodiles sunbathe on the riverbanks. Around July to September, rain depending, the Masai Mara is host to the famous wildebeest migration which is one of the few remaining mass migrations of mammals in the world. During this time herds of over a million wildebeest will trawl their way through this region and they become the major focus for predatory activity and drama unfolds at every corner.<br /><br />There are also options for a morning balloon safari or a half-day visit to Lake Victoria.<br /><br />Balloon Safari: As the balloon is inflated against the first rays of sunrise your pilot will go through safety procedures. Once aloft, the balloon floats gently over the plains, giving a bird's eye view of the game below as the sun creeps slowly over the horizon. After around one hour the balloon lands and nearby breakfast is already being prepared and, of course, glasses of bubbly to toast your flight in a tradition initiated by the Montgolfier brothers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lake Victoria Adventure: An early start this morning with a transfer to take you to the airstrip for a flight by light aircraft to Lake Victoria. On arrival enjoy an appetising full English breakfast before you board the boat for the morning. There will be the opportunity to try fishing for the legendary giant Nile perch found in these waters as you explore the myriad of tiny islands in this region of the lake. An experienced and knowledgeable fisherman captains each boat. There is the chance to stop at a traditional fishing village and see how the villagers live from day to day before returning to the airstrip for your return flight to the Masai Mara.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p>";

<h4>Day 11</h4>
<h5>Cape Town City Tour</h5>
<p>Please meet your representative in the reception area of the hotel from where you depart on a morning tour of Cape Town City.</p>
<p>You will be driven through the Cape Town suburb of Tamboerskloof ("Drummers' Ravine") to the lower cable car station on the slopes of Table
Mountain. Weather permitting you will make the short and comfortable ascent to the top of the mountain by cable car. The panoramic view of the
sea and city from the summit is magnificent.</p>
<p>Then you begin our tour of historic Cape Town. After the excitement of "summiting" Table Mountain, you may need some refreshments, so our
first stop will be the Bo Kaap area for an exclusive, traditional Cape Malay tea experience. Our host will tell you about her life growing up in the
charming Bo Kaap where bulbous minarets rise up above buildings festooned with cast-iron adornments from another age and cobble stoned
streets lead into cosy squares.</p>
<p>You will then take an easy walk through the tranquil Company Gardens (the remnants of the Dutch East India Company's fruit and vegetable
gardens) with notable important buildings including the Houses of Parliament, the Tuynhuis ("Townhouse" or Cape Town's "White House"),
National Art Gallery and National Library. From here we make our way to the Castle of Good Hope. Built between 1666 and 1679 by the Dutch
East India Company, this pentagonal fortification replaced a small clay and timber fort, built in 1652 by Commander Jan van Riebeeck, founder
of the maritime replenishment station at the Cape of Good Hope. The Castle Military Museum depicts the military history of the Cape, the Castle
and Cape Regiments. Also worth a visit is the William Fehr collection consisting of artwork reflecting many aspects of cultural life at the Cape
from the early VOC days until the middle of the 19th century.</p>
<p>End your tour visiting the notorious dungeon. As a result of rising damp, the dungeon was not fit to store gun powder as intended and was later
used as a prison for the accused awaiting trial.</p>
<p>The tour will end at the hotel or at the bustling Victoria & Alfred Waterfront, built around the old harbour. A hugely popular destination with
tourists and locals alike (80% of visitors are from Cape Town itself) the Waterfront is unique in terms of being a working harbour while still
boasting a varied selection of eclectic shops, restaurants and tourist attractions from scenic helicopter rides to boat cruises.</p>
<p>The remainder of the day is at leisure</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Cape Grace Hotel <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 12</h4>
<h5>Cape Point Tour</h5>
<p>Please meet your representative in the reception area of the hotel and depart on a full day tour to Cape Point.</p>
<p>Hugging the Atlantic coast road we journey past the "bikini beaches" of Clifton and Camps Bay, beautifully located at the base of the towering
Twelve Apostles Mountains. We travel over the Suikerbossie ("Sugar Bush") Pass and descend into the bucolic Hout Bay valley, with its bustling
fishing harbour and white sand beach.</p>
<p>From here we travel over the famous Chapman's Peak Drive (subject to road conditions) to join the sea again at the town of Noordhoek. This
historic road, high on the mountainside overlooking the sea, was once considered "impossible to build", but Charl Marais (mining surveyor) rose
to the challenge and made it happen at an estimated cost of £20 000 using 700 convict labourers.</p>
<p>Our journey continues to the Cape of Good Hope Nature Reserve at the end of the Cape Peninsula. The reserve, which covers 22000 acres of
land, converges in the south at Cape Point, a great pinnacle of rock. You can climb the steps or ride a funicular railway - the "Flying Dutchman" -
to the top from where you MAY see Southern Right whales in spring and early summer, dolphins and a variety of seabirds. The original
lighthouse at Cape Point was built in 1860. The present lighthouse, one of the most powerful in the southern hemisphere, is closer to the point
itself than the original.</p>
<p>We travel back through the reserve looking out for some of the animals that live here, including the rare Bontebok, Eland and Cape Mountain
Zebra.</p>
<p>En route to lunch we visit Boulders, a lovely beach sheltered from the wind and famous for its colony of endangered Jackass Penguins on the
coast of False Bay near Simon's Town. Boulders, had just two breeding pairs in 1982 but thanks to careful management the population has
grown to about 3000 in recent years. This is a rare and rewarding experience.</p>
<p>Pass through Simon's Town, which was the Royal Navy's main base in the south Atlantic from 1815 until 1957 and has the feel of a small English
seaside village with steep narrow streets and cobbled alleyways. You will learn about the famous hound called "Just Nuisance", the most
renowned animal in the annals of the Royal Navy.</p>
<p>Continue to Kalk Bay a quaint fishing hamlet on the False Bay coast with a protected little harbour of brightly painted wooden boats. At around
1pm the fishermen offload their catch and it is possible to buy your supper straight from the boat.</p>
<p>Travel back towards Cape Town passing through the attractive, upmarket suburb of Constantia, the cradle of the South African wine industry
boasting famous estates like Klein Constantia. At Kirstenbosch the world-renowned National Botanical Garden, recently voted one of the Top
Ten gardens in the World by the curators of Kew Gardens in London, a private, local guide ensures that you learn about some of the more
fascinating aspects of the gardens and get as much as possible out of the visit. We return to the hotel passing interesting sites such as the
University of Cape Town, Rhodes Memorial and Mostert's Mill, a Dutch windmill dating back to 1797.</p>

<h4>Day 14</h4>
<h5>Gourmet Tour of the Winelands</h5>
<p>Please meet your representative in the reception area of the hotel from where you will depart on a full day gourmet tour of the Winelands.</p>
<p>The Western Cape is blessed with a climate, which enables world-class wines to be made here in the midst of scenery - and on historic estates -
which even jaded eyes agree are breathtakingly beautiful.</p>
<p>The region is also an epicurean's dream with a host of top quality restaurants ready and able to seduce the palate with a myriad of taste
sensations, which are both internationally classic and yet uniquely local. On this exclusive gourmet experience you will sample some of the
award winning wines - and tastes - of the Western Cape.</p>
<p>Depart the hotel - and travel along the N1 National Highway to Anura Estate. Anura is situated in the foothills of the Simonsberg mountain range.
Here you will be able to sample their wines - and award-winning hand crafted Forest Hill cheeses.</p>
<p>Continue on to Waterford Wine Estate via the picturesque historic town of Stellenbosch - the second oldest town in South Africa - and also
known as the town of oaks. When you arrive at Waterford Wine Estate, you will have the opportunity to sample their award winning wines
complimented by a chocolate tasting.</p>
<p>After the wine and chocolate tasting you will enjoy lunch on the Kleine Zalze Estate at the Cape Winelands restaurant Terroir, which scooped the
year's most prestigious accolade on the gastronomic calendar. The Provencal-inspired chalkboard menu is dictated to seasonal, fresh and
organic produce from the region accompanied by wines from the area.</p>
<p>Once you have relaxed after lunch, continue to Somerset West, which lies in the valley beneath the Hottentot's Holland Mountains. Visit
Morgenster Estate for a wine, olive and olive oil tasting. Morgenster produces an extra virgin olive oil, which has been judged the best in the
world at a prestigious competition in Italy. The wines are also top ranking.</p>
<p>After this day of gourmet experiences, return to your hotel in the late afternoon and the evening is at leisure.</p>

Once aloft, the balloon floats gently over the plains, giving a bird's eye view of the game below as the sun creeps slowly over the horizon. After around one hour the balloon lands as breakfast is already being prepared and, of course, enjoy a glass or two of bubbly to toast your flight in a tradition initiated by the Montgolfier brothers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lake Victoria Adventure : An early start this morning with a transfer to the airstrip for a flight by light aircraft to Lake Victoria.

<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong>  5 days</p>
<p>This itinerary allows you to experience the natural wonders of Zambia, and its customised according to your interests of great wildlife viewing.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong> Johannesburg, Zambia, Livingstone and Botswana</p>

</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>Arrive in Johannesburg</h5>
<p>On arrival at OR Tambo the group should be able to proceed through transit directly into the International departures terminal where they will
board the flight for Livingstone. This procedure however depends on which airline they arrive into OR Tambo on, and whether or not their
luggage can be checked all the way through to Livingstone.</p>
<p>On arrival in Livingstone the group will have to clear customs and immigration and will have to purchase their double entry visas for Zambia.
Please note: Due to foreign currency laws in South Africa, we unable to carry the funds for the Visas – this amount would have to be transferred
directly to our offices in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>Your representative will escort you to the waiting air conditioned coaches and transferred to the Royal Livingstone Hotel.</p>
<p>On arrival at the Royal Livingstone Hotel a ROYAL reception awaits the group. On arrival at the hotel they will be escorted down to the
magnificent lawns of the Royal Livingstone hotel where canapés and cocktails await them. A separate check in desk will be setup for the group.
African maidens will welcome them with Nyami Nyami necklaces – the traditional Zambian River g-d symbol.</p>
<p>David Livingstone explored this land of potent beauty and discovered one of the seven natural wonders of the world. In his footprints, only
moments away from the mighty Zambezi River with the dramatic torrent of the Victoria Falls as its natural milieu, a magnificent Resort has been
created as a testament to his discovery and in reverence to the splendour of this World Heritage site. Journey to this magical place and witness
the greatest mass of falling water on earth as it plunges down a sheer rock face, spraying its mystical mist hundreds of meters in the air. The
awesome Victoria Falls is much closer to you here - literally on the doorstep of The Falls Resort - it feels as if you could reach out and touch it, as
it plummets into the chasm far below.</p>
<p>The local tribe’s people call it Mosi-Oa-Tunya - the Smoke that Thunders. On the forested banks of the great Zambezi River, upstream of the
mighty cataract where it thunders into the Batoka Gorge, is The Royal Livingstone, pride of Zambian hospitality. In its cool lounges and shaded
verandahs, you will encounter the elegance and luxury of an earlier, more courteous age.<br>
The Royal Livingstone is a serene and gracious refuge from the heat of the African sun. The 173 luxurious rooms with their comfortable
furnishings are tastefully decorated in the soft earth tones of the bushveld, with spreading views of the river and Acacia forest. For the discerning
traveler in search of luxury, extravagance and sheer indulgence, the Royal Livingstone Hotel will set your heart on fire and soothe your soul.</p>
<p>The innate heritage of the land offers guests nail-biting experiences ranging from water-rafting to bungee jumping, a paradise for wildlife lovers
with daily land and water safaris, and exceptional angling and fly-fishing.<br>
This magnificent Falls Resort allows you the chance to be at one with the uninhibited majesty of the Victoria Falls, a time to regroup, to find your
inner core and to leave enriched and empowered, promising to return.</p>
<p>A light lunch can then be served from the terrace of the Royal Livingstone hotel. The rest of the afternoon will be at leisure to relax and explore
this amazing resort.</p>
<p>Early evening we will place surprise outfits for each person in their rooms which they will have to wear that evening to Dinner. The group meets
in the reception area and when they are all gathered they will be startled by a “War Raid”. African warriors will come out of the darkness and do a
tribal ritual dance for the group and they will then escort them singing and dancing down to the Boma where a true African Feast awaits. (Please
note that the Boma Dinner can only be done as a buffet dinner)<br>
Tonight they will dine under the African Skies. During this magnificent feast they will be serenaded by a local marimba band.<br>
As an option the group can take the opportunity to learn a traditional dance move from one of the local dancers.</p>

<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Royal Livingstone Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Zambezi River</h5>
<p>Breakfast this morning will be served on the terrace and in the dining room at the Royal Livingstone.</p>
<p>Today is a day to explore a variety of activities that Livingstone has on offer. For a group of this size our suggestion would be as follows:</p>
<p>Tour of the Victoria Falls<br>
Flight of Angels – Helicopter flip<br>
Mkuni Village – Village Tour<br>
Visit to the local craft market</p>
<p>The main group would be split into 4 smaller groups and would rotate through the activities. They would then all meet for lunch and an elephant
interaction at the elephant Boma.</p>
<p>A tea / Coffee break can be arranged during the morning activities.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The group is to large to do elephant back safaris for the entire group which is why I suggest rather doing an elephant interaction. They
can touch / feed the elephants have their pictures taken with them.</p>
<p>The day will end with a spectacular sunset train journey to the Victoria Falls Bridge. The train stops for 10 minutes on the bridge and the group
can disembark to take pictures and enjoy a cocktail.<br>
The train is a Victorian Steam Train.</p>
<p>Dinner this evening will be a served dinner in the conference room. Alternatively a buffet dinner can be served at the Zambezi Sun around the
pooldeck – a white mischief dinner. Everyone dresses in white, the tables are laid in white with candles all around.<br>
A resident band will play during the dinner this evening.</p>

up and the adventure commences. Tonight you will get the chance to beat your own drums at your ”interactive drumming circle” which will take
place at the Zambezi Sun Dinner tonight will be served in the conference room at the Zambezi Sun and entertainment will be provided by a band.

<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>Chobe National Park</h5>
<p>Breakfast this morning will be served on the terrace and in the dining room at the Royal Livingstone.</p>
<p>After breakfast the group will depart in their coaches for the Kazungula Border Post en route to Botswana & Chobe National Park.</p>
<p>Today will be a relaxed day with the group crossing over the Zambian border into Botswana to go and spend the day in Chobe National Park.The
crossing from Zambia into Botswana is done on small speedboats as you cross over the Zambezi / Chobe River into Botswana. The transfer time
is ± 2 hours to Chobe.</p>
<p>The departure from the hotel is done at staggered intervals so as to not congest the groups at the border and to allow an easy crossing in the
boats. The boat trip takes about 3 minutes across the Chobe River – and ± 45 pax at 1 crossing can be accommodated.</p>
<p>On arrival in Botswana the group will split with ½ the group proceeding directly into Chobe National Park in 4x4 Game Drive vehicles and the
other ½ of the group proceeding to the river to commence their river safari.</p>
<p>Lunch today will be a buffet lunch at Mowana Safari Lodge and the entire group will meet for lunch.</p>
<p>After lunch the groups split again with ½ proceeding down to the jetty to board Safari Boats and to commence their River Safari and the other ½
proceeding to safari vehicles to commence their land safari in the Chobe National Park.<br>
Drinks will be served on the Safaris</p>
<p>Return to Mowana in the late afternoon for Sundowner drinks before transferring back to the border post to clear immigration, to board the
speedboat and cross back over into Zambia.</p>
<p><strong>DINNER</strong><br>
When the group gets back to the Royal Livingstone tonight it will be to discover pith helmets for the gentleman and white silk scarves for the
ladies in their rooms. They must don their costumes and dinner will be served on the lawns under the trees on the banks of the Zambezi River.
Dinner tonight is a David Livingstone Dinner.<br>
Entertainment tonight will be a classical flautist.</p>
<p><strong>CHOBE NATIONAL PARK</strong><br>
The Chobe National Park covers an area of approximately 11.700 square kilometers. Established in 1961 with the first Game Warden Mr. Pat
Hepburn appointed April 1962. It is home to the largest concentration of Elephants in Africa, estimated at 45, 000. Indigenous to the park is the
puku and Chobe Bushbuck, other game such as lion, leopard, buffalo, cheetah, kudu, giraffe and an abundant bird life of approximately 450
species, add theatre to the magical kingdom.</p>
<p>Ihaha camp, 20 km north of the Ngoma gate, the Chobe’s most accessible campsite. According to game drivers, Ihaha was once an inhabited
village, which was uprooted and shifted to Kasane when Chobe became a national Park. By day, campers are under constant surveillance by
cheeky baboons, which long ago leant that all the best pickings come from tents and backpacks.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to enjoy the riverfront is to take a river trip in the late afternoon, when the hippos amble onto dry land and the riverfront fills
elephants heading down for a drink and a romp in the water. A Chobe visit will probably entail a cruise or game drive during which you will have
an excellent change of observing lions and cheetah, and by day, the water is full of hippos which submerge at dawn and emerge at dusk. 
Buffaloes are present in their thousands, and amid the scrub live numerous giraffes and zebra.</p>

<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>Zambezi River</h5>
<p>Breakfast this morning will be served on the terrace and in the dining room at the Royal Livingstone.</p>
<p>An optional light lunch can be served at the hotel prior to departure for the airport – this however would depend on the flight departure time.
Currently the flights depart Livingstone at around lunch time – meaning that the departure from the hotel would have to be at around 11am.</p>
<p>On arrival at Livingstone Airport the group would check in for their flight – clear customs and immigration and board their flight to OR Tambo
International Airport in Johannesburg. Currently the group would have to disembark in Johannesburg, collect their luggage and then proceed to
the International Departures terminal to check in for their flight back home – you cannot check through from Livingstone.</p>

Around July to September, rain depending, the Masai Mara is host to the famous wildebeest migration which is one of the few remaining mass migrations of mammals in the world. During this time herds of over a million wildebeest will trawl their way through this region and they become the major focus for predatory activity and drama unfolds at every corner.<br /><br />There are also options for a morning balloon safari or a half-day visit to Lake Victoria.<br /><br />Balloon Safari: As the balloon is inflated against the first rays of sunrise your pilot will go through safety procedures. Once aloft, the balloon floats gently over the plains, giving a bird's eye view of the game below as the sun creeps slowly over the horizon.
