Look out for dolphins, whales, orcas and more. You could either sit back & watch the marine life, or take a plunge in & swim with them in their natural habitat. Light snacks & refreshments will also be available during the tour.</p>
<p>After this exhilarating experience, enjoy your lunch and later depart for a scenic flight over the region.
Enjoy the views of the Tauranga region before heading over vast expanses of flourishing native and pine forests to the many and varied geothermal areas of the Rotorua. You could choose either a helicopter or a floatplane to view some of the most dramatic geothermal scenery & activity the destination has on offer.</p>
Rotorua is also the heartland of New Zealand's Maori culture, and you can head back to Rotorua visiting Te Po for a cultural evening experience. Enjoy a performance of song and dance, followed by food cooked in traditional hangi style (an earth oven). Hear stories of the past & experience an authentic Maori welcome ceremony followed for a truly traditional cultural experience. </p>

<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>ROTORUA - LAKE TAUPO  </h5>
<p>Check out of your hotel this morning & enjoy about an hour and a half’s scenic drive towards Lake Taupo.</p>
<p>Driving Distance:	85 kms approx. </br>
Duration:	1.5 hrs approx. 
</p>
<p>Check into your hotel at Lake Taupo & depart to visit the famed Huka Falls, the most visited natural attraction in New Zealand. The Waikato is New Zealand's longest river & it moves gracefully from Lake Taupo. Just before the Huka Falls it enters a shallow ravine of hard volcanic rock and the effect is simply magical! A foot bridge right at the top of the falls puts you in a prime position to get up close and witness the spectacular display of more than 220,000 liters of water blasting by every second.</p>
<p>Post lunch; take a boat cruise to witness the Maori Rock Carvings around Lake Taupo.  In the late 1970s master carver Matahi Whakataka-Brightwell had completed his 10-year training with Maori elders & came to Lake Taupo to mark the occasion with a significant carving. He took inspiration from Ngatoroirangi, a visionary Maori navigator who guided the Tuwharetoa and Te Arawa tribes to the Taupo area over a thousand years ago. Get up & close to some of these amazing rock art – the main carving being over 10 metres high and was completed over four long summers!
</p>
<p>
This evening, perhaps enjoy a pre-dinner drink at the lodge & later enjoy a meal prepared with the freshest of ingredients organically grown around the lodge; overlooking the stunning lake & mountains.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Lake Taupo Lodge or similar <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>LAKE TAUPO   </h5>
<p>Head to Tongariro National Park for the legendary Tongariro Alpine Crossing! It is rated as ‘the best full day trek in New Zealand’ and listed by many as one of the 'top 10 day treks in the world'. Lonely Planet even said that a walk amidst the volcanoes of Tongariro is a life-changing experience not to be missed. The diverse and dramatic scenery and unique land forms are spectacular and you will experience some of the most scenic and volcanically active areas of the Tongariro National Park.</p>
<p>Stop by Bulli Point for some Cliff diving, Lake Taupo style! Take the plunge into the fresh blue water -there are three ledges at Bulli Point with the highest being seven metres.</p>
<p>Later this evening, maybe you could stop by the town center and enjoy some eclectic shopping or visit one of the quaint cafes that line the friendly streets.

Once aloft, the balloon floats gently over the plains, giving a bird's eye view of the game below as the sun creeps slowly over the horizon. After around one hour the balloon lands as breakfast is already being prepared and, of course, enjoy a glass or two of bubbly to toast your flight in a tradition initiated by the Montgolfier brothers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lake Victoria Adventure : An early start this morning with a transfer to the airstrip for a flight by light aircraft to Lake Victoria.

Each of the 18 plantation houses has been lavishly furnished and features a split level living area and a private deck.

The camp offers a peaceful setting for the traveller after a long day of game viewing. The camp is comprised of nine double tents and a mess tent with a common room.

During the dry season the animals migrate from as far north as Lake Natron, resulting in the resident population of wildebeest, zebra, eland, elephant, hartebeest, buffalo and fringe-eared oryx swelling and competing for Tarangire's permanent water pools.<br /></p>";

Descend to the crater floor by 4WD safari vehicle for a game drive unlike any other you will experience in Africa with the forest-covered crater walls rising around you. Enjoy a picnic lunch amongst the hippos and birds before visiting a Maasai village this afternoon.<br /><br />The floor of the crater is only 100 square miles but is home to around 30,000 animals with a high concentration of predators and some of the finest black-maned lions in Africa. Rhinos can be seen with calves at heel. Eland and waterbuck appear not to notice the human visitors, enabling photographers to shoot at ease. On the lake in the middle of the crater you may see thousands of flamingos, fluttering and shimmering like a pink heat haze. Zebra and wildebeest account for almost half the animals - gazelle, buffalo, eland, hartebeest and wart hog can also be seen.<br /></p>";
