<p>Driving Distance:	64 kms approx. <br />
Duration:	1 hrs approx.

<p>After this exhilarating experience, enjoy your lunch and later depart for a scenic flight over the region.

<p>Check into your hotel at Lake Taupo & depart to visit the famed Huka Falls, the most visited natural attraction in New Zealand. The Waikato is New Zealand's longest river & it moves gracefully from Lake Taupo. Just before the Huka Falls it enters a shallow ravine of hard volcanic rock and the effect is simply magical! A foot bridge right at the top of the falls puts you in a prime position to get up close and witness the spectacular display of more than 220,000 liters of water blasting by every second.</p>
<p>Post lunch; take a boat cruise to witness the Maori Rock Carvings around Lake Taupo.  In the late 1970s master carver Matahi Whakataka-Brightwell had completed his 10-year training with Maori elders & came to Lake Taupo to mark the occasion with a significant carving. He took inspiration from Ngatoroirangi, a visionary Maori navigator who guided the Tuwharetoa and Te Arawa tribes to the Taupo area over a thousand years ago. Get up & close to some of these amazing rock art – the main carving being over 10 metres high and was completed over four long summers!

During this time herds of over a million wildebeest will trawl their way through this region and they become the major focus for predatory activity and drama unfolds at every corner.<br /><br />There are also options for a morning balloon safari or a half-day visit to Lake Victoria.<br /><br />Balloon Safari: As the balloon is inflated against the first rays of sunrise your pilot will go through safety procedures. Once aloft, the balloon floats gently over the plains, giving a bird's eye view of the game below as the sun creeps slowly over the horizon. After around one hour the balloon lands as breakfast is already being prepared and, of course, enjoy a glass or two of bubbly to toast your flight in a tradition initiated by the Montgolfier brothers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lake Victoria Adventure : An early start this morning with a transfer to the airstrip for a flight by light aircraft to Lake Victoria.

Whether this is your first time on safari or a return trip the Serengeti will not disappoint.<br /><br />The Serengeti National Park is arguably the most famous national park in the world. The Serengeti perhaps defines the safari experience as surely as the wildlife that inhabits it. Established in 1951, and covering an area of almost 15,000 sq km, an area comparable to the state of Connecticut or Northern Ireland, the Serengeti hosts a fantastically diverse ecosystem. The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, where 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other plains game that follow close behind, make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";
