<h4>Day 11</h4>
<h5>Cape Town City Tour</h5>
<p>Please meet your representative in the reception area of the hotel from where you depart on a morning tour of Cape Town City.</p>
<p>You will be driven through the Cape Town suburb of Tamboerskloof ("Drummers' Ravine") to the lower cable car station on the slopes of Table
Mountain. Weather permitting you will make the short and comfortable ascent to the top of the mountain by cable car. The panoramic view of the
sea and city from the summit is magnificent.</p>
<p>Then you begin our tour of historic Cape Town. After the excitement of "summiting" Table Mountain, you may need some refreshments, so our
first stop will be the Bo Kaap area for an exclusive, traditional Cape Malay tea experience. Our host will tell you about her life growing up in the
charming Bo Kaap where bulbous minarets rise up above buildings festooned with cast-iron adornments from another age and cobble stoned
streets lead into cosy squares.</p>
<p>You will then take an easy walk through the tranquil Company Gardens (the remnants of the Dutch East India Company's fruit and vegetable
gardens) with notable important buildings including the Houses of Parliament, the Tuynhuis ("Townhouse" or Cape Town's "White House"),
National Art Gallery and National Library. From here we make our way to the Castle of Good Hope. Built between 1666 and 1679 by the Dutch
East India Company, this pentagonal fortification replaced a small clay and timber fort, built in 1652 by Commander Jan van Riebeeck, founder
of the maritime replenishment station at the Cape of Good Hope. The Castle Military Museum depicts the military history of the Cape, the Castle
and Cape Regiments. Also worth a visit is the William Fehr collection consisting of artwork reflecting many aspects of cultural life at the Cape
from the early VOC days until the middle of the 19th century.</p>
<p>End your tour visiting the notorious dungeon. As a result of rising damp, the dungeon was not fit to store gun powder as intended and was later
used as a prison for the accused awaiting trial.</p>
<p>The tour will end at the hotel or at the bustling Victoria & Alfred Waterfront, built around the old harbour. A hugely popular destination with
tourists and locals alike (80% of visitors are from Cape Town itself) the Waterfront is unique in terms of being a working harbour while still
boasting a varied selection of eclectic shops, restaurants and tourist attractions from scenic helicopter rides to boat cruises.</p>
<p>The remainder of the day is at leisure</p>

<h4>Day 12</h4>
<h5>Cape Point Tour</h5>
<p>Please meet your representative in the reception area of the hotel and depart on a full day tour to Cape Point.</p>
<p>Hugging the Atlantic coast road we journey past the "bikini beaches" of Clifton and Camps Bay, beautifully located at the base of the towering
Twelve Apostles Mountains. We travel over the Suikerbossie ("Sugar Bush") Pass and descend into the bucolic Hout Bay valley, with its bustling
fishing harbour and white sand beach.</p>
<p>From here we travel over the famous Chapman's Peak Drive (subject to road conditions) to join the sea again at the town of Noordhoek. This
historic road, high on the mountainside overlooking the sea, was once considered "impossible to build", but Charl Marais (mining surveyor) rose
to the challenge and made it happen at an estimated cost of £20 000 using 700 convict labourers.</p>
<p>Our journey continues to the Cape of Good Hope Nature Reserve at the end of the Cape Peninsula. The reserve, which covers 22000 acres of
land, converges in the south at Cape Point, a great pinnacle of rock. You can climb the steps or ride a funicular railway - the "Flying Dutchman" -
to the top from where you MAY see Southern Right whales in spring and early summer, dolphins and a variety of seabirds. The original
lighthouse at Cape Point was built in 1860. The present lighthouse, one of the most powerful in the southern hemisphere, is closer to the point
itself than the original.</p>
<p>We travel back through the reserve looking out for some of the animals that live here, including the rare Bontebok, Eland and Cape Mountain
Zebra.</p>
<p>En route to lunch we visit Boulders, a lovely beach sheltered from the wind and famous for its colony of endangered Jackass Penguins on the
coast of False Bay near Simon's Town. Boulders, had just two breeding pairs in 1982 but thanks to careful management the population has
grown to about 3000 in recent years. This is a rare and rewarding experience.</p>
<p>Pass through Simon's Town, which was the Royal Navy's main base in the south Atlantic from 1815 until 1957 and has the feel of a small English
seaside village with steep narrow streets and cobbled alleyways. You will learn about the famous hound called "Just Nuisance", the most
renowned animal in the annals of the Royal Navy.</p>
<p>Continue to Kalk Bay a quaint fishing hamlet on the False Bay coast with a protected little harbour of brightly painted wooden boats. At around
1pm the fishermen offload their catch and it is possible to buy your supper straight from the boat.</p>
<p>Travel back towards Cape Town passing through the attractive, upmarket suburb of Constantia, the cradle of the South African wine industry
boasting famous estates like Klein Constantia. At Kirstenbosch the world-renowned National Botanical Garden, recently voted one of the Top
Ten gardens in the World by the curators of Kew Gardens in London, a private, local guide ensures that you learn about some of the more
fascinating aspects of the gardens and get as much as possible out of the visit. We return to the hotel passing interesting sites such as the
University of Cape Town, Rhodes Memorial and Mostert's Mill, a Dutch windmill dating back to 1797.</p>

<h5>Gourmet Tour of the Winelands</h5>

<p>The Western Cape is blessed with a climate, which enables world-class wines to be made here in the midst of scenery - and on historic estates -
which even jaded eyes agree are breathtakingly beautiful.</p>
<p>The region is also an epicurean's dream with a host of top quality restaurants ready and able to seduce the palate with a myriad of taste
sensations, which are both internationally classic and yet uniquely local. On this exclusive gourmet experience you will sample some of the
award winning wines - and tastes - of the Western Cape.</p>
<p>Depart the hotel - and travel along the N1 National Highway to Anura Estate. Anura is situated in the foothills of the Simonsberg mountain range.
Here you will be able to sample their wines - and award-winning hand crafted Forest Hill cheeses.</p>
<p>Continue on to Waterford Wine Estate via the picturesque historic town of Stellenbosch - the second oldest town in South Africa - and also
known as the town of oaks. When you arrive at Waterford Wine Estate, you will have the opportunity to sample their award winning wines
complimented by a chocolate tasting.</p>
<p>After the wine and chocolate tasting you will enjoy lunch on the Kleine Zalze Estate at the Cape Winelands restaurant Terroir, which scooped the
year's most prestigious accolade on the gastronomic calendar. The Provencal-inspired chalkboard menu is dictated to seasonal, fresh and
organic produce from the region accompanied by wines from the area.</p>
<p>Once you have relaxed after lunch, continue to Somerset West, which lies in the valley beneath the Hottentot's Holland Mountains. Visit
Morgenster Estate for a wine, olive and olive oil tasting. Morgenster produces an extra virgin olive oil, which has been judged the best in the
world at a prestigious competition in Italy. The wines are also top ranking.</p>

Your elegant African-themed suite is set on an elevated platform in the tree line, with a wooden deck that offers expansive views over the river and lagoon. Tonight, get close to nature - and each other - when you roll your bed onto the deck for the unique opportunity to sleep under the stars.</p>

<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5> Okavango Delta</h5>
<p>Game-viewing options flourish at Baines' Camp. Resting on 260,000 acres in a private concession neighboring the famed Moremi Game Reserve, the area is superb for viewing wildlife by land in open safari vehicles or on the water from a poled mokoro (dugout canoe). However, sometimes the best way to tune into the bush is on foot. Walking safaris are a specialty at your camp, and skilled guides introduce you to the area's natural wonders.

</p>
<p>
Return from a night game drive for a relaxing "star bath," a freestanding traditional Botswana-style zinc bathtub set out on your private deck, surrounded by lanterns.</p>
<p>Philanthropic Activities: During your time at Baines' you have the opportunity to participate in an educational experience with a group of semi-habituated African elephants. After a few safety tips from your mahout (trainer), you are encouraged to touch each of the elephants and lead one of them while it gently rests the tip of its trunk on your hand. You may even get a "kiss" on the cheek from one of your new friends. At a picnic spot under large shade trees, sit down and relax with cold refreshments and brunch. The elephants are fed pre-cut fodder, and you can observe them eating and playing together after their lunch.</p>

Sanctuary Chief's Camp is made up of 12 luxury bush pavilions - each with a spacious seating area and game-viewing deck with a hammock.

<h5> Okavango Delta</h5>
<p>Game viewing in the Moremi is nothing short of spectacular. In addition to 400 species of birds, ostrich, antelope, crocodile, wildebeest, kudu and hippo are common here. However, the area has been dubbed the "predator capital" of Botswana, boasting leopard, cheetah, painted wild dog, spotted hyena and a large resident pride of lion. Game drives are conducted in custom-built open vehicles, offering an ideal viewing vantage point. While you are here, you may wish to take an optional helicopter excursion for a different perspective on the wildlife. A specially prepared romantic dinner is also in store for you during one of your evenings at Chief's.</p>

<h4>Day 9</h4>
<h5>Chobe National Park/Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe</h5>
<p>Travel overland this morning, crossing the border into Zimbabwe toward breathtaking Victoria Falls and your accommodations at the world-famous Victoria Falls Hotel. Built in 1904, the Victoria Falls Hotel's gracious colonial style epitomizes the romance of grand travel. Late this afternoon, set out on a private cruise on the Zambezi River aboard Ra-Ikane, a small luxury boat that reflects the ambience of a bygone era. Glide lazily down the river looking for hippo, elephant or buffalo coming to drink at the water's edge and absorb the stillness of the African bush as sunset brings the day to a close.</p>

<h4>Day 10</h4>
<h5>Victoria Falls/Johannesburg/Depart</h5>
<p>The final day of your adventure begins with an exclusive "Flight of Angels" that offers the amazing opportunity to travel above the majestic falls in a helicopter for unrivaled views of the crashing waters. When you are back on the ground, set out on a walking tour of Victoria Falls. Notice the permanent rainbows that crisscross the gorge, producing images that are more like paintings than reality. The unique tropical rainforest that veils the edge of the falls, the rising spray and thundering roar as these waters break against the ragged rocks below make a sight and sound never to be forgotten. Later, transfer to the airport and fly to Johannesburg for your homebound flight.</p>

<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong>  11 days</p>
<p>Discover the diverse wildlife in Botswana's top parks and game reserves.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong> Johannesburg, Botswana, Selinda Game Reserve and Moremi Game Reserve </p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>ARRIVE JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA </h5>
<p>On arrival at OR Tambo International Airport your representative will meet and assist you to your hotel.</p>

<p>Your representative will meet and assist you with check-in formalities.</p>
<p>Depart Johannesburg on a scheduled flight to Botswana where upon arrival in Maun a representative will meet and assist you to your shared light aircraft transfer to Selinda.</p>
<p>Selinda Camp is a comfortable tented safari camp situated on the banks of the eastern Selinda Spillway, a waterway linking Botswana's Okavango Delta to the Linyanti Swamps. Situated along the Spillway is a private wildlife reserve where only a handful of guests can experience some of Africa's finest wildlife.

<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D </p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>Selinda Reserve </h5>
<p>Today is at leisure to enjoy the game viewing activities on offer.</p>
<p>Activities include: Early morning and late afternoon/early evening 4x4 open vehicle game drives, guided wildlife bush walks, boating when water levels permit, in-room massages. At Selinda Camp there is no set routine. The wildlife knows the most forgiving times of day, and we take its lead. Early morning, late afternoon and evenings are the prime game viewing times - it's when colours are vibrant, the sun is low and spirits are up.  Alternatively, setting out at dawn, when predators are active, our guides are as keen as the guests to discover the riches of each day in Selinda Reserve. </p>
<p>Usually, once the sun is high and strong, we retreat with the herds to our midday resting post, Selinda Camp. Then, as the sun begins to wane again, we head out for the late afternoon to evening, searching for nocturnal wildlife and the action that comes with sunset. But nothing is regimented. Regimes don't suit Selinda, which is why we all love being out here in the first place.</p>
<p>Selinda Reserve is famous for elephant and lion, wild dog and hippo, buffalo and giraffe. Some days we will spend hours with a single herd of elephants; other days we may track cheetah, or wait in a hide for Slaty egrets to arrive and fish. Wattled cranes, a highly coveted sighting, are often spotted here.</p>

<p>Arrive at Jack's Camp, pitched on a low grassland knoll amongst an oasis of dignified desert palms and Kalahari acacia. The camp's hub is a romantic canvas pavilion of low spires and finials with a fluttering valance beneath its eaves and could be the site for a medieval jousting tourney were it not a deciduous green. Three poles support the main chamber where everyone meets for meals at a long communal dining table.</p>
<p>Ten green roomy and stylish canvas tents with en-suite bathrooms, indoor and outdoor showers (for those who want to
feel the Kalahari breeze on their skin) have been fashioned in classical 1940's style creating an oasis of civilization in what can be the harshest of stark environments.Persian rugs underfoot, cool cotton sheets and mahogany and brass campaign-style kit from the family safari stores form a striking contrast with the rugged wilderness viewed from the comfort of one's own verandah.</p>
<p>Head off after tea in the beautiful afternoon light, stop to watch the sun set and listen to an explanation of how the pans, the remnants of the world's largest ever super-lake, were formed.</p>

<h5>Botswana Makgadikgadi Pans </h5>
<p>The day is at leisure to enjoy the game viewing activities on offer.</p>
<p>Set off in the morning to visit some of the Kalahari's sexiest meerkats. ('suricate' to science minded people and 'Timon' to Lion King fans). Get up close and personal with these captivating creatures. On chilly mornings, you might well find a meerkat snuggling up to you for warmth. Or, in the absence of a termite mound or tree, using your head as a sentry lookout post. By spending quality time with these incredibly social, superbly adapted animals, you will be able to see how they interact with each other and their environment. You also get the chance to see the desert through the eyes of a meerkat - which, despite the fact that it's only a foot off the ground, is a pretty spectacular vantage point, and definitely one of the most special and memorable game experiences you will encounter in Botswana.</p>
<p>After a picnic breakfast, visit a remote cattle post to learn about the traditional culture of the Botswana people.</p>
<p>Close by is the famous Chapman's Baobab (Also known as the Seven Sisters) which is acknowledged to be the largest tree in Africa, and was the campsite of early explorers like Livingstone and Selous when they pioneered the area. This gives you an opportunity to gain a fascinating insight into the history of the early explorers.</p>
<p>Return to camp for a rest and refreshing lunch.</p>
<p>Later in the afternoon after tea, travel down to the pans where you will be given a brief safety talk before mounting your trusty quad bike to head off across the pans. Watch the sun set and the stars rise. This is one of the only places in the world where the silence is so complete you can hear the blood circulating through your ears.</p>
<p>Return to camp with your evening at leisure.</p>

<li>
<h4>Day 11</h4>
<h5>MAKGADIKGADI PANS/MAUN /JOHANNESBURG </h5>
<p>Spend the morning walking with Zu/'hoasi Bushmen Trackers.</p>
<p>It has long been their belief that it is a vitally important tool in terms of preserving this unique, but sadly fast vanishing, culture. Jack's Camp has been working closely with the Zu/'hoasi people of the Western Kalahari for many years and are privileged to have a small group of these extraordinary men at their service to guide guests on a morning's walking safari. Offering a window into the past, they'll teach you how they have survived in this harshest of environments, using their vast and ancient knowledge of plants, animal behaviour and survival skills.</p>
<p>Say your farewells and drive to the airstrip in preparation for your flight to Maun and onward to Johannesburg.</p>

						description = description + "<p>The next two days are yours to enjoy game viewing as you venture out in open 4X4 vehicles led by your expert driver/guide. A wide range of activities are offered at Olonana and you can plan your day to be as active or as leisurely as you wish. Visit the adjacent Maasai village, take a morning bush walk with an armed ranger or enjoy sundowners in the evening or even dinner under the stars in the middle of the African bush.<br /><br />In the Mara, the wildlife is abundant and the swaying grasslands ensure that animals are never out of sight. Elephants browse amongst the large herds of wildebeest, topi, gazelle, eland and buffalo. The plains offer a rich variety of food for the dominant predators: lion, leopard, hyena and cheetah. In the Mara River, hippos submerge while crocodiles sunbathe on the riverbanks.<br /><br />Around July to September, rain depending, the Masai Mara is host to the famous wildebeest migration which is one of the few remaining mass migrations of mammals in the world. During this time herds of over a million wildebeest will trawl their way through this region and they become the major focus for predatory activity and drama unfolds at every corner.<br /><br />There are also options for a morning balloon safari or a half-day visit to Lake Victoria.<br /><br />Balloon Safari: As the balloon is inflated against the first rays of sunrise your pilot will go through safety procedures. Once aloft, the balloon floats gently over the plains, giving a bird's eye view of the game below as the sun creeps slowly over the horizon. After around one hour the balloon lands as breakfast is already being prepared and, of course, enjoy a glass or two of bubbly to toast your flight in a tradition initiated by the Montgolfier brothers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lake Victoria Adventure : An early start this morning with a transfer to the airstrip for a flight by light aircraft to Lake Victoria. On arrival enjoy an appetising full English breakfast before you board the boat for the morning. There will be the opportunity to try fishing for the legendary giant Nile perch found in these waters as you explore the myriad of tiny islands in this region of the lake. An experienced and knowledgeable fisherman captains each boat. There is the chance to stop at a traditional fishing village and see how the villagers live from day to day before returning to the airstrip for your return flight to the Masai Mara.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p>";
