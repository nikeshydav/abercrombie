<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>

<p>Relive the ambience of a bygone era on this journey through the riverine forests, expansive delta and spectacular game-filled bush land of Botswana. Romance is in the air - literally - when you sleep under the stars on an elevated platform and share a lantern-lit "star bath" on your private deck. The euphoria continues on a private sundowner cruise as you admire enjoy your beautiful surroundings and the array of wildlife that comes to the water's edge.</p>
</li>

home to the five star Forum Homini. The Cradle of Humankind is a World Heritage site and the world's richest hominid site.</p> 
<p>The twelve luxury suites at Forum Homini are partly submerged by veld grass roots forming part of the view of the rolling landscapes. These
rooms are like luxurious caves with shutter concrete roofs that open up onto the view beyond. These suites included handmade stalactite lights,
magnificent fireplaces, a luxury king size bed, large oval baths and open air showers.</p>

<h4>Day 11</h4>
<h5>Cape Town City Tour</h5>
<p>Please meet your representative in the reception area of the hotel from where you depart on a morning tour of Cape Town City.</p>
<p>You will be driven through the Cape Town suburb of Tamboerskloof ("Drummers' Ravine") to the lower cable car station on the slopes of Table
Mountain. Weather permitting you will make the short and comfortable ascent to the top of the mountain by cable car. The panoramic view of the
sea and city from the summit is magnificent.</p>
<p>Then you begin our tour of historic Cape Town. After the excitement of "summiting" Table Mountain, you may need some refreshments, so our
first stop will be the Bo Kaap area for an exclusive, traditional Cape Malay tea experience. Our host will tell you about her life growing up in the
charming Bo Kaap where bulbous minarets rise up above buildings festooned with cast-iron adornments from another age and cobble stoned
streets lead into cosy squares.</p>
<p>You will then take an easy walk through the tranquil Company Gardens (the remnants of the Dutch East India Company's fruit and vegetable
gardens) with notable important buildings including the Houses of Parliament, the Tuynhuis ("Townhouse" or Cape Town's "White House"),
National Art Gallery and National Library. From here we make our way to the Castle of Good Hope. Built between 1666 and 1679 by the Dutch
East India Company, this pentagonal fortification replaced a small clay and timber fort, built in 1652 by Commander Jan van Riebeeck, founder
of the maritime replenishment station at the Cape of Good Hope. The Castle Military Museum depicts the military history of the Cape, the Castle
and Cape Regiments. Also worth a visit is the William Fehr collection consisting of artwork reflecting many aspects of cultural life at the Cape
from the early VOC days until the middle of the 19th century.</p>
<p>End your tour visiting the notorious dungeon. As a result of rising damp, the dungeon was not fit to store gun powder as intended and was later
used as a prison for the accused awaiting trial.</p>
<p>The tour will end at the hotel or at the bustling Victoria & Alfred Waterfront, built around the old harbour. A hugely popular destination with
tourists and locals alike (80% of visitors are from Cape Town itself) the Waterfront is unique in terms of being a working harbour while still
boasting a varied selection of eclectic shops, restaurants and tourist attractions from scenic helicopter rides to boat cruises.</p>
<p>The remainder of the day is at leisure</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Cape Grace Hotel <br />

<h4>Day 12</h4>
<h5>Cape Point Tour</h5>
<p>Please meet your representative in the reception area of the hotel and depart on a full day tour to Cape Point.</p>
<p>Hugging the Atlantic coast road we journey past the "bikini beaches" of Clifton and Camps Bay, beautifully located at the base of the towering
Twelve Apostles Mountains. We travel over the Suikerbossie ("Sugar Bush") Pass and descend into the bucolic Hout Bay valley, with its bustling
fishing harbour and white sand beach.</p>
<p>From here we travel over the famous Chapman's Peak Drive (subject to road conditions) to join the sea again at the town of Noordhoek. This
historic road, high on the mountainside overlooking the sea, was once considered "impossible to build", but Charl Marais (mining surveyor) rose
to the challenge and made it happen at an estimated cost of £20 000 using 700 convict labourers.</p>
<p>Our journey continues to the Cape of Good Hope Nature Reserve at the end of the Cape Peninsula. The reserve, which covers 22000 acres of
land, converges in the south at Cape Point, a great pinnacle of rock. You can climb the steps or ride a funicular railway - the "Flying Dutchman" -
to the top from where you MAY see Southern Right whales in spring and early summer, dolphins and a variety of seabirds. The original
lighthouse at Cape Point was built in 1860. The present lighthouse, one of the most powerful in the southern hemisphere, is closer to the point
itself than the original.</p>
<p>We travel back through the reserve looking out for some of the animals that live here, including the rare Bontebok, Eland and Cape Mountain
Zebra.</p>
<p>En route to lunch we visit Boulders, a lovely beach sheltered from the wind and famous for its colony of endangered Jackass Penguins on the
coast of False Bay near Simon's Town. Boulders, had just two breeding pairs in 1982 but thanks to careful management the population has
grown to about 3000 in recent years. This is a rare and rewarding experience.</p>
<p>Pass through Simon's Town, which was the Royal Navy's main base in the south Atlantic from 1815 until 1957 and has the feel of a small English
seaside village with steep narrow streets and cobbled alleyways. You will learn about the famous hound called "Just Nuisance", the most
renowned animal in the annals of the Royal Navy.</p>
<p>Continue to Kalk Bay a quaint fishing hamlet on the False Bay coast with a protected little harbour of brightly painted wooden boats. At around
1pm the fishermen offload their catch and it is possible to buy your supper straight from the boat.</p>
<p>Travel back towards Cape Town passing through the attractive, upmarket suburb of Constantia, the cradle of the South African wine industry
boasting famous estates like Klein Constantia. At Kirstenbosch the world-renowned National Botanical Garden, recently voted one of the Top
Ten gardens in the World by the curators of Kew Gardens in London, a private, local guide ensures that you learn about some of the more
fascinating aspects of the gardens and get as much as possible out of the visit. We return to the hotel passing interesting sites such as the
University of Cape Town, Rhodes Memorial and Mostert's Mill, a Dutch windmill dating back to 1797.</p>

<h5>Gourmet Tour of the Winelands</h5>
<p>Please meet your representative in the reception area of the hotel from where you will depart on a full day gourmet tour of the Winelands.</p>
<p>The Western Cape is blessed with a climate, which enables world-class wines to be made here in the midst of scenery - and on historic estates -
which even jaded eyes agree are breathtakingly beautiful.</p>
<p>The region is also an epicurean's dream with a host of top quality restaurants ready and able to seduce the palate with a myriad of taste
sensations, which are both internationally classic and yet uniquely local. On this exclusive gourmet experience you will sample some of the
award winning wines - and tastes - of the Western Cape.</p>
<p>Depart the hotel - and travel along the N1 National Highway to Anura Estate. Anura is situated in the foothills of the Simonsberg mountain range.
Here you will be able to sample their wines - and award-winning hand crafted Forest Hill cheeses.</p>
<p>Continue on to Waterford Wine Estate via the picturesque historic town of Stellenbosch - the second oldest town in South Africa - and also
known as the “town of oaks”. When you arrive at Waterford Wine Estate, you will have the opportunity to sample their award winning wines
complimented by a chocolate tasting.</p>
<p>After the wine and chocolate tasting you will enjoy lunch on the Kleine Zalze Estate at the Cape Winelands restaurant Terroir, which scooped the
year's most prestigious accolade on the gastronomic calendar. The Provencal-inspired chalkboard menu is dictated to seasonal, fresh and
organic produce from the region accompanied by wines from the area.</p>
<p>Once you have relaxed after lunch, continue to Somerset West, which lies in the valley beneath the Hottentot's Holland Mountains. Visit
Morgenster Estate for a wine, olive and olive oil tasting. Morgenster produces an extra virgin olive oil, which has been judged the best in the
world at a prestigious competition in Italy. The wines are also top ranking.</p>

</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>Arrive in Cape Town</h5>
<p>On arrival in Cape Town you will be met and transferred to The Victoria and Alfred Hotel.</p>
<p>Framed by the ocean and Table Mountain, the elegance and luxury of the Victoria and Alfred Hotel is rivaled only by its relaxed atmosphere and warm personal service.</p>
<p>Built in 1904 as the North Quay Warehouse and converted in 1990 to a luxury hotel, it is named in honour of the Queen of England and her son who visited the Cape in 1870, when Prince Alfred officially opened the Breakwater basin, today's Victoria & Alfred Waterfront. It's the detail that gives the Victoria &amp; Alfred Hotel its elegance, intimacy, romance and reputation - the wooden staircase, the telescope, flowers and the service makes this hotel friendly and efficient yet never intrusive.</p>
<p>There are just 68 spacious, air-conditioned, en-suite rooms with separate bath, shower and toilet coffee and tea making facilities, private bar, safe, trouser press, dvd player, satellite television and wireless internet.

<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>Cape Winelands</h5>
<p>This morning you leave Cape Town and head into the Cape Winelands.</p>
<p>Here you will check in at the Village of Spier</p>
<p>The Village at Spier, a 155-bed hotel set along the banks of the Eerste River, on the Spier Estate just outside Stellenbosch in the heart of the world-renowned Cape Winelands. Spier offers many entertainment and leisure options for both the relaxed and the robust. There are a number of different restaurants, the Spier festival which takes place once per year, there is cocktails at Toto's, tennis, swimming, encounters with eagles and cheetahs, horse rides through vineyards, wine tasting, quiet walks through the estate gardens, birdwatching train trips, picnics from the Spier Deli, the hotel spa and, of course, golf.</p>
<p>Throughout Spier's history, there have been twelve owners. From 1692 when Governor Simon van der Stel granted the land to Arnout Janz, up until 1993 when current owner Dick Enthoven purchased Spier. In the year 1812, while Spier was under the ownership of the Van Der Byl family, the old stable house became unsuitable for the accommodation of slaves. It was then that the Van Der Byl family erected the new Slave House. Today we know the Slave House as the Café Spier and the old stable house is now the Wine Centre. Meticulous renovation has restored the gracious Cape Dutch buildings to their former glory and today the scenic surroundings set the stage for a celebration of the finer things in life.</p>
<p>The Village at Spier comprises thirty-two double-storey buildings grouped around six private courtyards, each with its own pool and entertainment area. It offers guests 155 spacious rooms, including four suites and nine Villa rooms. All are simply, yet elegantly, appointed in traditional country style. The Village introduces a new era of luxury accommodation in South Africa. Designed to recreate the intimate and relaxed atmosphere of a small village, its 155 rooms, including four suites and nine villa rooms, are connected by indigenous gardens, walkways and waterways.</p>
<p>These 'homes' are clustered around six private courtyards, each with its own swimming pool and entertainment area for your personal use. In both design and construction, emphasis has been placed on maintaining the ecological integrity of the area. Where possible, natural materials and resources have been used. At 60 square metres apiece, rooms at The Village are more spacious than those currently offered in five-star establishments and are elegantly and simply appointed in the traditional country style. During spring and summer, doors open onto the gardens and entertainment areas. Come winter, light up the fireplace and settle in for the night.</p>
<p>Activities at Spier: Wine centre and Shop, Jonkershuis Restaurant</p>
<p>Spier Deli, Moyo, Cheetah Outreach Centre, Cheetah Outreach assists the Cheetah Conservation Fund, Eagle Encounters, Walks and Trails and Horse Riding.</p>

<p><strong>SINGITA SWENI LODGE (A RELAIS AND CHATEAUX PROPERTY)</strong></p>
<p>Singita Kruger National Park is situated where two rivers meet, in an exclusive game-rich 33 000-acre concession in the world-renowned Kruger National Park. Boasting the highest concentration of wildlife in the entire park, including the 'Big 5', the area is also known for its majestic Mountain Pride of lions and unique Euphorbia trees. Sweni Lodge was influenced by the structures of dens, warrens and lairs found in the area.</p>
<p>Flanking the Sweni River, this tranquil sanctuary is elevated on stilts with decks of timber. The six secluded suites, with tactile furnishings, have been carefully created to bring in the textures and shades of the bush. Designed with open-plan living in mind, your suite flows from the bathroom area, through to the lounge and into the bedroom - yet if you wish, each area may be sealed off by curtains.

Sabi Sabi has the unique advantage of being the only Private Game Reserve on the perennial Sabi River, biologically the richest waterway in South Africa. Here you can still observe at close quarters the natural relationship between predator and prey. Big game abounds and roams freely through this pristine part of our ancient African continent.</p>
<p>Earth Lodge is a sanctuary symbolising a new era in luxury South African safari lodges. Sculpted into a slope of the earth, almost invisible in the landscape, the lodge uses texture, light and space to present a lodge like no other. As in nature everything at Earth Lodge exists in harmony and you are immediately aware of a sense of calm and a restoring spirit. Home to 13 ultra-luxurious suites including the Amber Presidential Suite, the lodge breaks with traditional bush lodge style to create a masterpiece of artistry and innovation. Each of the suites at this luxury lodge features individually designed furniture, private plunge pool, en-suite glass fronted bathroom, indoor and outdoor shower and butler services. The outdoor boma, its walls sculpted from tree roots and piled up piece by piece, captures the drama of the African night and evokes the power of the wilderness. An indoor/outdoor dining area overlooking a waterhole and unending bushveld, a secluded library, art gallery, meditation garden; and an underground wine cellar with a collection of over 6000 bottles of rare wines, the venue for an unforgettable dining experience - everything at this luxury lodge has been created for your indulgence.</p>

						description = description + "<p align=justify>Meet the guide this morning in the reception area of the hotel for a full day Family tour of the Cape Point.</p><p align=justify>This tour will take us south of Cape Town city centre to the very end of the scenically dramatic Cape Peninsula. Hugging the Atlantic coast road we journey past the bikini beaches of Clifton, Camps Bay and Llandudno, beautifully located at the base of the towering Twelve Apostles Mountains. We travel over the Suikerbossie (Sugar Bush) Pass and descend into the bucolic Hout Bay valley, with its bustling fishing harbour, white sand beach and picturesque village.<br /></p><p align=justify>In Hout Bay we will cruise the waters to Seal Island, home to the Cape Fur Seal. It is a wondrous show to behold - a water ballet by a thousand seals, pirouetting, diving and surfacing to a symphony of gull cries, timpani courtesy of the South Atlantic swell gently keeping time against the ancient granite shore. If you want to see a special part of the Peninsula from another perspective, this is about as good as it gets.</p><p align=justify>We travel over the famous Chapman's Peak Drive (subject to road conditions) to join the sea again at the town of Noordhoek. This historic road, high on the mountainside overlooking the sea, was once considered impossible to build, but Charl Marais (mining surveyor) rose to the challenge and Chapman's Peak Drive was opened to the public in 1922. Our journey continues to the Cape of Good Hope Nature Reserve at the end of the Cape Peninsula.</p><p align=justify>The reserve, which covers 22000 acres of land, converges in the south at Cape Point, a great pinnacle of rock. You can climb the steps or ride a funicular railway - the Flying Dutchman - to the top from where you may see southern right whales in spring and early summer, dolphins and a variety of seabirds. The original lighthouse at Cape Point was built in 1860.</p><p align=justify>The present lighthouse, one of the most powerful in the southern hemisphere, is closer to the point itself than the original. An alternative option (for the more energetic) is to take a scenic cliff-top trail to the Cape of Good Hope itself, the most south-westerly point in Africa, where your guide and vehicle would meet you. Afterwards we travel back through the reserve looking out for some of the animals that live here, including the rare Bontebok, Eland, Cape Mountain Zebra and Ostrich.</p><p align=justify>En route to lunch we visit Boulders, a lovely beach sheltered from the wind and famous for its colony of endangered Jackass Penguins on the coast of False Bay near Simon's Town. Boulders, had just two breeding pairs in 1982, but thanks to careful management the population has grown to about 3000 in recent years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p align=justify>Pass through Simon's Town, which was the Royal Navy's main base in the south Atlantic from 1815 until 1957 and has the feel of a small English seaside village with steep narrow streets and cobbled alleyways. You will learn about the famous hound called Just Nuisance, the most renowned animal in the annals of the Royal Navy. We continue to Kalk Bay the quaint fishing hamlet on the False Bay coast with a protected little harbour of brightly painted wooden boats.</p><p align=justify>The narrow main street is renowned for antique and art shops which make fascinating browsing. We lunch in Kalk Bay before journeying back into Cape Town via Boyes Drive for wonderful views of the harbour. We emerge above Muizenberg a famous location in South African history as it was the site of the Battle of Muizenberg in 1795 when British forces invaded the Cape and defeated the Dutch colonists.</p><p align=justify>We travel back towards Cape Town passing through the attractive, up-market suburb of Constantia, the cradle of the South African wine industry boasting famous estates like Klein Constantia. We continue to Streetwires passing interesting sites such as the University of Cape Town, Rhodes Memorial and Mostert's Mill, a Dutch windmill dating back to 1797 and still in working order.&nbsp;</p><p align=justify>Thereafter we return to the hotel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";

This World Heritage Site is one of the places where man is believed to have originated.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You will visit the private, working site of Drimolen which was only discovered in 1992 and is already the third richest hominid site in Southern Africa. Access to this site is by arrangement only. On 26 April 2000, the discovery of the most complete female Australopithecus robustus skull along with a complete male jaw which made world headlines.&nbsp;</p><p>This site has unearthed 79 hominid fossils, a wealth of faunal remains and some fossil Homo babies. As the site is being excavated all year round, it provides an excellent opportunity to see an excavation in progress. On arrival at Drimolen, you will be served tea, coffee and refreshments at a secluded picnic site while a short fossil cast demonstration and talk on human evolution is presented by a scientist.&nbsp;</p><p>This will be followed by a guided tour of the actual fossilferous deposit of Drimolen where fossils at least 1.2 million years old may be viewed. A light, catered picnic lunch will be provided under the trees, before heading back to Johannesburg for a guided visit of the South African Museum of Rock Art at the Origins Centre. This world-class facility was recently opened at the University of the Witwatersrand. The museum has an outstanding, and fascinating, collection of rock paintings, engravings and artifacts, but more importantly, the history of South Africa is told through the art of the San people. If we want to understand the culture, the spiritual beliefs, and the very essence of the Zulu and Xhosa people as they are today, and even the reasons for the development of Soweto and other townships - we need to take a step back a few hundred years, and follow the path that the rock art stories can tell us.&nbsp;</p><p>Originally San rock art was seen as just pictures of animals and people, and narrative accounts of the hunter-gatherer life. Only now have researchers discovered the spiritual meaning behind the rock art, and their importance. Rock paintings and engravings have proved a valuable tool for Nature Conservationists, as the San provided historical evidence of wildlife species that occurred in their area hundreds of years ago.</p><p>Return to your hotel in the late afternoon.</p>";

Funds are raised for CCF to support their efforts in releasing trapped, wild cheetah and non-lethal predator control methods (i.e. placement of guard dogs in Namibian farmlands). Cheetah Outreach was founded by Annie Beckhelling in January 1997 on a hectare of land donated by Spier. The education programme began with two cheetahs: Inca (6-year old male) whose role was to greet visitors at Spier and Shadow (1-year old male) who travelled to community events.</p><p align=justify>At Spier, with an annual visitor-ship of 650,000 people, the cheetah ambassadors are able to greet more than 10% of the guests. Since our successful beginning, Cheetah Outreach quickly expanded with the arrival of three cubs in September 1997. Nyana-Spier, Charlie-Girl and Moya enjoyed the public attention.

The aim is to bridge the gap between the wild world of the Baboons and the civilised world of their human cousins.</p><p>The remaining Chacma Baboons on the southern peninsula (close to Cape Town), face a bleak future as continued urbanization reduces wilderness areas, resulting in on-going conflict situations between man and baboon. Due to the unacceptably high mortality rates it was predicted that within 15 years the baboons would face certain extinction. At the current mortality rate there will not be a viable baboon population on the peninsula within the next 10 years.</p><p>The Baboon Monitor Project was started in 1999 and over the past five years has considerably reduced the conflicts between primates by keeping baboons out of villages for 85% of days. The project employs 8 men from the nearby community of Masiphumelele. These men have been working closely with the baboons and have gained a wealth of wildlife experience as well as developing unique relationships with the baboons of the Da Gama and Slangkop troops. Funding for the Baboon Monitor Project is an on-going concern as pressing social issues dominate the current funding situation in South Africa.</p><p>To support this important conservation initiative, 25% of net proceeds from this walk will be utilized to ensure the continuation of the Baboon Monitor Project. By taking part in this excursion, you are showing your support for this important conservation initiative. You will be guided across the mountains around Cape Town to spend time with the last remaining Chacma Baboons in the Cape Peninsula. For 2-3 hours you will be walking through the mountain fynbos until you encounter the baboons in their home territory.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to sit and watch these fascinating animals as they eat, play and socialize around you.
