<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong>  19 days</p>
<p>The ideal introduction to Ecuador, this comprehensive programme includes the diverse mainland highlights as well as a visit to the magnificent Galapagos Islands.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong>  Quito, Cotacachi, Otavalo, Cotopaxi, Quilotoa, Riobamba, Cuenca, Cajas National Park, Gualaceo, Guayaquil, Galapagos.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>ARRIVE QUITO - COTACACHI</h5>
<p>Arrival in Quito this afternoon where you will be met and directly transferred to the hotel in Cotacachi.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> La Mirage Garden Hotel & Spa <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>OTAVALO - EL ANGEL RESERVE - OTAVALO</h5>
<p>This morning you will drive north towards the El Angel Ecological Reserve. This valley of glacial origin is located 170 km north of Quito between 3,000 and 4,000 metres above sea level. Weather ranges from 5ºC to 18ºC. Rain is frequent as well as fog. This area is part of one of the most bio-diverse regions in the world, and it features the frailejones - an endemic plant of the paramos in Venezuela, Colombia, Peru and Ecuador, which consists of one single empty trunk with no branches that hosts a wide variety of invertebrates in the interior. Its leaves are thin and protect themselves against the cold weather with a thick furry layer. </p>
<p>
Here you will be able to explore and observe two unique different ecosystems: the Polylepis and Frailejones, amid water streams, brooks, small cascades and magical surroundings.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> La Mirage Garden Hotel & Spa<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>OTAVALO - QUITO</h5>
<p>This morning visit the famed local market villages showcasing their acclaimed handicrafts. </p> 
<p>
With a population of about 18,000, Otavalo is justly renowned for its friendly people and their market, a gathering that has occurred here since pre Incan times. Although native Ecuadorians meet in Otavalo to trade for animals, food and other essentials, you may be more interested in the wide selection of crafts on display.  Otavaleños are the most prosperous Indian group in the country   perhaps because their weavings, carpets, bread dough sculptures, colourful ponchos, Indian jewellery and needlework are so attractive. Other visits include San Antonio de Ibarra, a nearby village famous for its woodcarvings, Ilumán, well known for its traditional felt Indian hats and Peguche, home of the Otavalo Indians.</p>
<p>
Lunch will be at Pinsaqui. Built in 1790, the Pinsaquí estate was originally a textile mill which exported to the United States. Over the years the hacienda has hosted scores of famous visitors, including Venezuelan liberator Simon Bolívar, who regularly stayed here during his trips from Ecuador to Bogotá.</p>
<p>
Return to Quito in the afternoon for your overnight at the Plaza Grande. This unique boutique property located in the heart of colonial Quito offers 15 spacious suites, each luxuriously appointed. The evening is at leisure.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Plaza Grande<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>QUITO - COTOPAXI</h5>
<p> After breakfast you will be transferred to a private hangar at the Quito Airport where you will board a Bell 407 helicopter with a capacity for five people. We will take you on a one hour flight over the Corazón, Pasochoa and Cotopaxi volcanoes. As you fly over this central part of the Andes mountain range you will enjoy the stunning Andean scenery of the "Avenue of the Volcanoes", so-called by Alexander Von Humboldt, the German scientist that came to Ecuador in the 18th century.</p>
  <p>         
At the end of the helicopter ride you will land near Hacienda San Agustin de Callo. This hacienda offers a wonderful insight into the Incan architecture to the north of their influence, whilst offering unrivalled views of the world's highest active volcano, Mount Cotopaxi. Discover the area through a variety of excursions whether it is on horseback, cycling or visiting the local markets on foot.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Hacienda San Agustin de Callo<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>COTOPAXI - QUILOTOA - RIOBAMBA</h5>
<p>Begin you day with a visit to Quilotoa Lake. Drive through a fantastic Andean landscape towards the western side of the mountain range. From the road, you cannot see the breathtaking, aquamarine crater lake until you approach the rim. Then the whole lake and its vista are unvelied. The three other sides of the volcano have a ragged, rugged high ridge with a 1500 ft drop which makes it impossible to climb. However, from the village look-out point you can see the majestic volcanic lake which is approximately three kilometres in size.</p>
<p>
Lunch is at a pretty, cozy mountain inn before you continue towards Riobamba. Surrounded by spectacular snowcapped peaks such as Chimborazo (at 6,310 m, Ecuador's highest peak), Riobamba, the former capital of Ecuador, is known as the Sultan of the Andes. With its colonial architecture and cobblestone streets, Riobamba's Old Town is a favourite among foreign tourists, with Parque Pedro Vicente Maldonado being a particularly interesting destination. Other places worth visiting are the Natural Science Museum at Colegio Maldonado, the religious art museum in the Concepción Convent.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Hosteria Abraspungo<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5> RIOBAMBA - CUENCA</h5>
<p>After an early breakfast, you will leave your hotel and drive to Cuenca via Alausi, where the main train station is located. You will stop at the Inca ruins of Ingapirca, meaning "The Inca wall" in Quichua.  It is the most important complex of ruins existing in the country and was built on top of Cañari constructions which go back to 1200. The Incas conquered the Cañaris and started the construction of their temple in 1460. The purpose of this place was for worshipping the sun. It was also used as a calendar for agricultural purposes.The complex also has other important sections such as the ancient residing place of the virgins of the sun and the Inca baths. There is also a small museum onsite with some pieces from both Cañari and Inca civilisations.</p>
 <p>Lunch en route before continuing to Cuenca to your hotel.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Mansion Alcazar<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L</p>
</li>

<li>
<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>CUENCA</h5>
<p>Full day tour of Cuenca, considered by most Ecuadorians as the most beautiful city in the country. It was declared a World Cultural Heritage site in 1999 by UNESCO. Today, you will do a walking tour along its cobbled stoned streets, flowery plazas and picturesque sites. This private tour is as flexible as you want it to be, so you can choose to visit museums (The Conceptas Monastery Religious Art Museum or the Archaeological Museum of the Central Bank), plazas or visit the Homero Ortega Panama Hat factory after lunch.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Mansion Alcazar<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 8</h4>
<h5>CAJAS NATIONAL PARK</h5>
<p>Leave Cuenca and drive to El Cajas National Park, one of Ecuador's natural wonders. Cajas boasts glacial lakes, strange rock formations, numerous species of flora and fauna and breathtaking waterfalls. There is also an array of exotic wildlife including the hummingbird and condor. El Cajas National Park offers great trout fishing opportunities in several of the 235 glacier type lakes, an amazing environment of moorland vegetation and spectacular rock formations.</p>
<p>
Should you want to try fishing at El Cajas, the first stop will be La Toreadora lake, at 3,900 metres above sea level and which you will reach after a 15 minute walk. This lake is a perfect introduction to the beautiful reserve. El Cajas geology has glacial origin and its flora is responsible for holding and keeping an important fresh water resource for the Southern Andes. Your next stop will be the lakes called Unidas (with a one hour walk) and Patoquinuas ( with a 90 minute walk).</p>
<p>
Before you continue your fishing activities, a delicious lunch will be offered at Dos Chorrera where you might want to try their specialty, trout.

After the beach time you will have a chance to deep water snorkel from the panga at Gardner Islet.</p>
<p>
Punta Suarez, also on Española Island  is one of the most popular and attractive sites in the Galapagos. Due to its isolation from other islands, it has a high proportion of endemic fauna. A few steps inland from the landing site, groups of Española marine iguanas bask in the sun. Further inland, Nazca and blue-footed boobies nest almost on the trail, Galapagos doves peck around unaware of visitors and finches go about their business. The trail continues towards a blowhole, which is a fissure in the lava where water spurts high into the air like a geyser. The cracks in the cliffs are home to swallow-tailed gulls and red-billed tropicbirds. Further up the cliff in an area of low-lying trees you will find waved albatrosses nesting. The 10,000 to 12,000 pairs of albatrosses on Española represent the entire population of this species on the planet. They perform one of the most spectacular courtship rituals of the animal world.</p>

<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong>  9 days </p>
<p>Discover the lush jungle and varied wildlife of Ecuador in this programme which also includes sightseeing in Quito.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong> Quito, Napo Wildlife Center, Tulipe, Otavalo.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>ARRIVE QUITO</h5>
<p>Arrival in Quito and transfer to the Plaza Grande Quito.</p>
<p>
Opened in late 2006, this incredible boutique property, located right on Quito's main Independence Square, has quickly become the premier choice for FITs in the Ecuadorian capital. Rooms offer stunning views and unbeatable levels of comfort, and guests are literally spoiled for choice for food and drink, with three different restaurants and two bars - quite incredible for a hotel that has only fifteen suites.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Plaza Grande Quito</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>QUITO - NAPO WILDLIFE CENTER</h5>
<p>Transfer to the airport this morning to board a 35 minute flight to Coca, where you will board a motor canoe that will take you up the Napo River to Napo Wildlfe Center.</p>
 <p>
Set on the shores of Lake Añangucocha a short distance south of the river, the Napo Wildlife Center is a joint project between the local Quechua Añangu community and a US-based NGO. Accommodation is some of the best in the Ecuadorian Amazon, but remains rustic in character. The lodge is a particularly good choice for ornithologists - over 550 species of bird have been spotted in this 88 acre complex, and it is home to two of Ecuador's most accessible parrot clay licks, where eight to ten species of parrot are commonly seen in their thousands. Eleven species of monkey are also present, as are jaguars, pumas, tapirs, caimans and macaws. There is also a 120 foot high canopy platform from which allows you to appreciate the wildlife of the area at tree-top level.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Napo Wildlife Center<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>NAPO WILDLIFE CENTER</h5>
<p>Visitors will be divided up into small groups, and lead by a native Anangu guide, who is also an official Yasuni Park Ranger. Your guide is an expert on the forest's secrets, learn about medicinal plants and other useful items in the rainforest, and also has a great deal of knowledge about tropical forest biology. Guides will create informative enjoyable excursions every day providing an educative fun experience. Groups and guides will tailor their excursions while taking advantage of the highest peaks of activity and weather conditions in the forest. Outings will be scheduled before dawn or at sunrise. This will maximise wildlife observation. Each group will decide with their guide how extreme and intense they want their Amazon excursion; this also applies for afternoon excursions and night outings, when an overwhelming concert of natural sounds will flood the atmosphere.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Napo Wildlife Center<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>NAPO WILDLIFE CENTER</h5>
<p>One of the highlights at NWC is going out on a very early excursion to reach two of Ecuador's most accessible parrot clay licks along the Napo region. These parrot clay licks are part of the reserve and lodge territory. These are two of over a dozen clay licks found on Anangu territory. Our parrot clay licks can be reached by following the Giant Otter Creek downstream by dug out canoe near the Napo River. The Napo Wildlife Center has exclusively constructed well established and comfortable blinds in each parrot lick in order to provide visitors with the best viewing and high quality photo/video opportunities.</p>
<p>
Activity kicks off at main lick between 7 and 8 in the morning and at second blind after midday. Species include Mealy, blue headed, yellow crowned, orange winged and orange cheeked parrots, cobalt winged, dusky headed and white eyed parakeets, with the occasional rarities like scarlet shoulder parrot let and scarlet macaws. In best weather conditions at least 800 individuals of most species can be spotted and in other days despite the rain a few dozen can still be seen. This can be a full day excursion visiting both blinds equipped with a nice freshly made box lunch, or a half day visiting the main lick and returning for a served lunch at the lodge. Don't miss his superb natural event full of unique sounds and brightly coloured plumages.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Napo Wildlife Center<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>NAPO WILDLIFE CENTER</h5>
<p>NWC has a large lake with two creeks that can be easily explored while sitting on a dugout canoe paddled by expert guides eager to spot and show you wildlife. The possibilities are endless in finding many species of monkeys like squirrel, saddle-backed and white fronted capuchin monkeys, or those that by natural distribution or best habitat occur only on the South side of the Napo such as the monk saki, spider, woolly and golden mantle tamarin monkeys. NWC is home to a total of eleven species of monkeys.</p>
<p>
Paddling on the creeks, there is a good chance of seeing a group of giant otters in a hurry to catch their fish for supper. Creeks have dense vegetation on both sides, with large trees overhead and calm flowing waters; no one knows exactly what waits in the next meander, a flooded forest with anaconda or a gentle easy moving three toed sloth.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Napo Wildlife Center<br />

<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 10 days</p>
<p>A fantastic introduction to Ecuador - visiting the capital Quito, the world renowned Galapagos Islands and Cotopaxi National Park.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong> Quito, Galapagos, Cotopaxi. </p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>ARRIVE QUITO</h5>
<p>Arrival at Quito Airport, you will be met and transferred to your hotel.</p>
<p>
Rich in history, Quito is the second highest capital city in the world, founded in 1534 by Spanish Conquistador Sebastian de Benacazar.  For nearly three centuries, the arts and intellectual societies flourished under Spanish colonial rule until 1809, when Quito established the first self-governing junta in the colonies. Liberator Simon Bolivar led the country as part of the Republic of Greater Colombia until 1830, when the Republic of Ecuador announced its independence with the adoption of the Constitution signed in Riobamba.  Due to the city's preservation of its blended past, UNESCO declared Quito a World Heritage Site in 1978.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Swissotel Quito</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>QUITO</h5>
<p>Begin your tour of Quito with a stop at Panecillo Hill. With spectacular views of the surrounding mountains and the city below, Panecillo Hill also hosts a statue of Quito's "Winged Virgin" visible from almost anywhere in the city. </p> <p>
Marvel at the city's ornate churches, cathedrals and baroque architecture, and experience a long history of local culture in Quito's Old Town. Visit San Francisco Church, dedicated to Quito's patron saint, and rich in art treasures, fine woodcarvings and altars of gold leaf. You will also see La Compañía Church, a Jesuit church with an elaborate façade, whose glittering interior was created with seven tons of gold.</p>
<p>
The City's Museum has a splendid exhibition of the history of Quito since pre-Inca times to the 20th century. The museum is located at the San Juan de Dios building which was the first hospital of the city back in the 16th century. The building has been completely restored and adapted to host the interesting history of Quito.</p>
<p>
After lunch rest of the afternoon will be at your leisure.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Swissotel Quito<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>QUITO - GALAPAGOS</h5>
<p>Transfer to the airport for your flight to Galapagos (via Guayaquil).  Arrival in Galapagos and transfer to the Royal Palm Hotel.</p>
<p>
Visit the breeding centre and Giant Tortoise pens located at Puerto Ayora, where you will witness the various stages of development of these world renowned indigenous tortoises that can easily outlive us. While enjoying a close encounter with these impressive animals you will hear all about their fascinating life history and the story of Lonesome George, one of the more famous island residents. Don't forget to ask your guide to visit the interpretation centre showing the natural history of the islands.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Royal Palm<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>GALAPAGOS - BARTOLOME ISLAND</h5>
<p>Board the M/Y Nortada this morning. You will spend the day at Bartolome Island - famous for Pinnacle Rock, a towering spearheaded obelisk that rises from the ocean's edge and is the best known landmark in the islands. Galápagos penguins, the only species of penguin found north of the equator, walk precariously along narrow volcanic ledges at its base. Sea lions snooze on rocky platforms, ready to slide into the water to play with passing snorkelers. Just below the surface, shoals of tropical fish dodge in and out of the rocks past urchins, sea stars and anemones. A perfectly crescent, pink and white sandy beach lies just to the east of the pinnacle. Sea turtles use the beach as a nesting site and can sometimes be found wading in the shallow water near the shore, or resting in the sand to recover from the arduous task of digging nests, laying eggs and covering them.</p>
<p>
Penguins dot the nearby rocks of the next landing site, less than a kilometre along the eastern shore. Here the submerged walls of a tiny volcanic crater give the impression of a fountain pool. This dry landing is the entrance to a 600 metre (2,000 foot) pathway complete with stairs and boardwalks leading to Bartolome's summit. The route is not difficult and presents a museum of vulcanology; a site left untouched after its last eruption, where cones stand in various stages of erosion and lava tubes form bobsled-like runs from the summit. At the top you will be rewarded with spectacular views of Santiago Island and James Bay to the west, and far below, Pinnacle Rock and the beach, where the crystal blue waters of the bay cradle your yacht.</p>
<p>Lunch will be on board your yacht. Return to your hotel around 5:30 pm.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Royal Palm<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>GALAPAGOS - SOUTH PLAZA ISLAND</h5>
<p> South Plaza Island (Plaza Sur) is the southern partner of two small crescent-shaped islands that lie just a few hundred metres off the east coast of Santa Cruz. The northern island is used for scientific purposes only. South Plaza is one of the smallest yet richest islands in the archipelago. Only 130 metres wide (426 feet), it was formed from uplifted seabed, giving it a titled tabletop quality. Our landing is in the channel between North and South Plaza, where the island tilts toward the water.</p>
<p>
The turquoise waters of the channel contrast brilliantly with the white sand and black lava of the shoreline. The rocks have grown thick with green seaweed in places, speckled with bright orange "Sally light foot" crabs. Further up the shore a carpet of scarlet sesuvium succulents serves as groundcover for a grove of luminescent green prickly-pear cactus. Yellow-gray land iguanas sit beneath, waiting patiently for pears to drop.</p>
 <p>
The trail gradually follows the tilt of the island to the cliffs that overlook the ocean to the south, where swallow-tailed gulls nest. Red-billed tropic birds, masked and blue-footed boobies ride the windy currents. The overlook is a great place for spotting large marine life, including manta rays. Surf pounds an inlet at the western corner of the island, where a colony of sea lion bachelors make their home, accounting for the surface of the rocks, polished by the oils of their fur. The shoreline of Las Plazas makes for excellent snorkeling in a sea lion colony of nearly a thousand. Your guide will find the right spot to swim with youngsters away from areas claimed by the surly bulls.</p>
<p>
Lunch will be on board your yacht. Return to your hotel around 5h30 pm.</p>
<p>

<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>GALAPAGOS - QUITO - COTOPAXI</h5>
<p>Transfer to the airport for your flight to Quito (via Guayaquil).</p>
<p>
Upon arrival in Quito drive to Hacienda San Agustin de Callo, built on the site of an important Inca ruin. The original Inca walls have been incorporated into the structure of this unique colonial hacienda, which offers today's astute traveller an unrivalled glimpse into a glorious past. Since the 15th century it has served as an Inca fortress, Agustinian monastery, temporary home for the French Geodesic Mission's Alexander Von Humboldt, and permanent country home for two ex-presidents of Ecuador.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> San Agustin de Callo Hacienda<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 8</h4>
<h5>COTOPAXI</h5>
<p>This morning you will be driven to the Cotopaxi National Park, the most visited in the whole of Ecuador. The park offers an excellent opportunity to see the Andean páramo (high grasslands) and its interesting flora and fauna. The park's centrepiece, Mount Cotopaxi (5,897 m / 19,300 ft) is Ecuador's second highest peak and one of the world's highest active volcanoes.</p>
<p>
On arrival in the park, your guide will point out the typical plant species and indicate some of the wildlife native to the park, including highland hummingbirds.</p>
<p>
After a short visit to the Information Centre, make your way towards Lake Limpiopugno, located on the northern slopes of Mount Cotopaxi at 3,800 metres above sea level. Take a walk around this lake and also visit the Inca Salitre ruins. In the area around the lake and the ruins it is common to see wild horses and llamas.</p>
<p>
After lunch, continue your exploration of Cotopaxi's flora and fauna. You may even attempt to climb up to the Cotopaxi's base camp, 4,800 meters / 15,750 feet above sea level and with excellent views out over the National Park.</p>
<p>
Late afternoon back to your hacienda.</p>

Visit the adjacent Maasai village, take a morning bush walk with an armed ranger or enjoy sundowners in the evening or even dinner under the stars in the middle of the African bush.<br /><br />In the Mara, the wildlife is abundant and the swaying grasslands ensure that animals are never out of sight. Elephants browse amongst the large herds of wildebeest, topi, gazelle, eland and buffalo. The plains offer a rich variety of food for the dominant predators: lion, leopard, hyena and cheetah. In the Mara River, hippos submerge while crocodiles sunbathe on the riverbanks.<br /><br />Around July to September, rain depending, the Masai Mara is host to the famous wildebeest migration which is one of the few remaining mass migrations of mammals in the world. During this time herds of over a million wildebeest will trawl their way through this region and they become the major focus for predatory activity and drama unfolds at every corner.<br /><br />There are also options for a morning balloon safari or a half-day visit to Lake Victoria.<br /><br />Balloon Safari: As the balloon is inflated against the first rays of sunrise your pilot will go through safety procedures. Once aloft, the balloon floats gently over the plains, giving a bird's eye view of the game below as the sun creeps slowly over the horizon. After around one hour the balloon lands as breakfast is already being prepared and, of course, enjoy a glass or two of bubbly to toast your flight in a tradition initiated by the Montgolfier brothers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lake Victoria Adventure : An early start this morning with a transfer to the airstrip for a flight by light aircraft to Lake Victoria. On arrival enjoy an appetising full English breakfast before you board the boat for the morning. There will be the opportunity to try fishing for the legendary giant Nile perch found in these waters as you explore the myriad of tiny islands in this region of the lake. An experienced and knowledgeable fisherman captains each boat. There is the chance to stop at a traditional fishing village and see how the villagers live from day to day before returning to the airstrip for your return flight to the Masai Mara.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p>";
