</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>Arrive Dublin</h5>
<p>On arrival today, you will be met and privately transferred to the hotel in the city centre where your tour director is waiting to greet you. The remainder of the day is at leisure to relax after the flight. You may wish to join our local guide on an afternoon orientation tour of the Irish capital. This tour will include a visit to Trinity College Library to see the Book of Kells.

<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Dublin</h5>
<p>This morning, meet an expert on Irish cuisine for a walking tour of the city centre, during which the development of eating habits in Ireland and the contemporary food scene in the 21st century will be discussed. The tour includes visits to various outlets to see how food is presented in stores in Dublin. Product tasting is, of course, included. The outlets will include a cheese store, a traditional butcher and a shop selling delicious cakes.</p>
<p>
After a light lunch, take a panoramic tour of Dublin that will pass the statue-lined O'Connell Street, the Georgian squares, St. Patrick's Cathedral and the President's palace in Phoenix Park. Not surprisingly the tour will end at the Guinness Storehouse, home to Ireland's most celebrated export. Here we are treated to a guided tour of the Storehouse, where the history and production methods of this unusually dry stout are relayed. As part of the tour, learn how to pour a perfect pint of Guinness - which of course can be enjoyed afterwards!</p>

<h5>The Wicklow Mountains - Ballyknocken and Powerscourt</h5>
<p>Following the gourmet treats of last night, today it is back to basics. Drive south from Dublin into the Wicklow Mountains region, and head to the renowned Ballyknocken House, Farm and Cookery School. Here we learn about the basics of Irish cooking. The experience includes a hands-on class on how to make perfect Irish soda scones, and a demonstration of how to make a traditional Irish stew using local lamb from the surrounding mountains. A rustic farmer's lunch is then taken in the hay barn, followed by a tasting of whiskey and the once-illegal poitin.</p>
<p>

<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>Cork - English Market and Blarney Castle</h5>
<p>This morning we drive to Dublin's Heuston train station to board a train to Cork, the principal city in the south of Ireland. After a journey of nearly three hours, arrive at Kent Station and drive straight to the English Market, ironically one of the most noted food markets in Ireland. Inside the market hall there is a huge range of Irish produce available for sale, from meat and fish to fruit and vegetables. Lunch will be taken at the Farmgate Café, overlooking the hall, where fresh local ingredients are used in the carefully prepared dishes. After checking into our hotel, your tour director will lead an excursion to Blarney Castle. This 15th century tower house is famed for the eponymous stone set in the parapet that is said to give the 'Gift of the Gab' to anyone who kisses it.</p>
<p>
This evening, drive to the picturesque coastal village of Kinsale for dinner. This village is often considered to be the gourmet capital of Ireland on account of the large number restaurants located here.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Hayfield Manor<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>Kerry</h5>
<p>Leave the hotel this morning for a journey west into the region known as West Cork which extends over to the bays of the Atlantic Coast. This area has become well established as a leading centre for artisanal cheeses including Durrus, Milleens and Gubbeen. We will stop at one of the factories to learn about cheese making in this area and to enjoy the fresh produce.</p>
<p>
Our route then leads us along the Beara Peninsula to Castletownbere, the leading port in Ireland for white fish landing. Hear about the importance of the fishing industry to the local economy before enjoying lunch of freshly caught fish in a local hostelry.</p>
<p>
This afternoon, drive over the Caha Mountains to the colourful town of Kenmare where there is time to shop for souvenirs. Return to Cork via the Old Kenmare Road, a section of the fabled Ring of Kerry which cuts through the beautiful Killarney National Park.</p>

<p>Today is spent at Ballymaloe. Run by legendary chef Darina Allen, this is unquestionably the most celebrated cookery school in Ireland. After arrival, the chefs will offer a demonstration on the techniques used in preparing quality dishes from Irish ingredients. Then it's time for work as we are given the opportunity to make the dishes ourselves.</p>
<p>
At the end of the session enjoy the fruits of our labour in well-deserved late lunch, after which we take a tour of the extensive gardens of the school where all the vegetables and herbs used in the courses are grown.</p>
<p>We return to the hotel past Midleton, home to one of the world's largest distilleries. The majority of spirits from Ireland are distilled here, including Jameson's Whiskey and Cork Dry Gin. The evening is at leisure for us to dine independently in Cork City.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Hayfield Manor<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>Cork - Foynes - Galway</h5>
<p>Leave Cork this morning and drive north across the dairying country of Counties Cork and Limerick, before reaching the estuary of the River Shannon, the longest river in the British Isles. On the south shore is Foynes, an otherwise unremarkable town that was the site of the first commercial transatlantic passenger service arrival in 1939. The plane used was a Boeing 314 'Flying Boat'. Although no original specimen has survived, we will visit the replica that has been constructed to experience these early flying conditions. Although short-lived, the main legacy of Foynes is Irish coffee. In 1942, Joe Sheridan decided that transatlantic passengers needed something stronger than ordinary coffee to revive them after the flight, and so introduced the original Irish coffee. Learn how to make proper Irish coffee in a master class using Irish whiskey and fresh local cream.</p>
<p>
Lunch will be served at nearby Glin Castle, an 18th century mansion overlooking the estuary in the company of the Knight of Glin, the owner of the property. This afternoon, cross the Shannon by ferry and continue north to the Cliffs of Moher, one of the most iconic sites in Europe. These sandstone cliffs drop 400 feet into the Atlantic, and offer a magnificent spectacle.</p>
<p>
Our route leads past Galway Bay, home to some of the finest oyster beds in Europe. Continue to our hotel near Galway city. Dinner this evening will be a la carte in our hotel.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Glenlo Abbey<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 8</h4>
<h5>Connemara</h5>
<p>This morning we drive west into the unspoiled region of Connemara. This is one of the principal areas in Ireland where salmon is fished in the rivers, and as a consequence smoked salmon is one of the main products from this area. Visit the Connemara Smokehouse, where the proprietors will welcome us and show us how salmon is filleted and prepared for the delicate smoking that imparts a distinctive flavour. Samples are of course included.</p>
<p>
Lunch will be taken nearby at Errisbeg House, a delightful property surrounded by peaceful gardens. Richard, the seventh Duke de Stacpoole will be our host, and he will reveal how a French ducal family came to own this idyllic property.</p>
<p>
This afternoon, continue to the Twelve Bens of the Connemara National Park, and down to Killary harbour, now home to Ireland's mussel farming industry. Return to the hotel from here. This evening drive to Clarinbridge for dinner at Moran's Oyster Cottage where guests may sample the famous oysters reared in Galway Bay, or a wide range of alternative seafood dishes.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Glenlo Abbey<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 9</h4>
<h5>Galway - Clonmacnoise - County Kildare</h5>
<p>We leave our hotel this morning and head east across County Galway until we reach the River Shannon once more. On the banks of the river, in an isolated but beautiful setting, are the ruins of Clonmacnoise, one of the most important medieval monastic sites in Europe.</p>
<p>
After a guided tour of the site, board a boat on the River Shannon and cruise north through the crossing town of Athone onto Lough Ree, one of the two large lakes on the River Shannon. Lunch will be enjoyed at the Wineport Lodge on the shores of the lake.</p>
<p>
This afternoon continue across the flat midlands of Ireland to Kilbeggan, home to a 'boutique' whiskey distillery, owned by Cooley, the main independent whiskey distiller in Ireland. An in-house expert leads us on a tour over the small plant where the liquor is produced, before tasting the brands of whiskey the distiller has to offer.</p>
<p>
The journey ends at our hotel in the countryside near Dublin, where we have a 'Farewell to Ireland' dinner.</p>

On the lake in the middle of the crater you may see thousands of flamingos, fluttering and shimmering like a pink heat haze.

The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, when 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other game that follow close behind make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";

<p>A wonderful day spent in the Cotswold Hills, regarded as one of the most quintessentially English parts of the country.

There is free time for lunch in Bourton-on-the-Water, one of the most picturesque of the Cotswold villages. This afternoon continue to one of England's great gardens, Hidcote Manor.

<p>

<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>The Eden Project and the Lost Gardens of Heligan</h5>

Lunch will be taken at the Eden Project.</p>
<p>
After lunch visit the Lost Gardens of Heligan. In their heyday, the estate gardens at Heligan were one of the glories of Cornwall with a number of farms, quarries, woods, a flour mill, a sawmill, a brewery, productive orchards and kitchen gardens. Yet with the outbreak of the First World War more than half the staff were to perish in battle and although the Tremayne family returned after the war they eventually moved on and rented the property to friends. Decades of neglect had consigned these beautiful gardens to the history books until the present owners began the daunting task of restoring Heligan to its former glory. As the gardens have remained unaltered since the Victorian era, they provide a fascinating insight into estate life at the end of the 19th century. Returning to Tresanton, dinner is at leisure this evening.</p>

<p>
This afternoon board a ferry and travel to the island of Tresco, only two miles long and home to the famous Tresco Abbey Gardens.

Known for over a decade as one of southern England's best restaurants, Le Poussin's Michelin starred chef Alex Aitken is bound to prepare a lunch to remember.</p>

A wide range of activities are offered at Olonana and you can plan your day to be as active or as leisurely as you wish. Visit the adjacent Maasai village, take a morning bush walk with an armed ranger or enjoy sundowners in the evening or even dinner under the stars in the middle of the African bush.<br /><br />In the Mara, the wildlife is abundant and the swaying grasslands ensure that animals are never out of sight. Elephants browse amongst the large herds of wildebeest, topi, gazelle, eland and buffalo. The plains offer a rich variety of food for the dominant predators: lion, leopard, hyena and cheetah. In the Mara River, hippos submerge while crocodiles sunbathe on the riverbanks.<br /><br />Around July to September, rain depending, the Masai Mara is host to the famous wildebeest migration which is one of the few remaining mass migrations of mammals in the world. During this time herds of over a million wildebeest will trawl their way through this region and they become the major focus for predatory activity and drama unfolds at every corner.<br /><br />There are also options for a morning balloon safari or a half-day visit to Lake Victoria.<br /><br />Balloon Safari: As the balloon is inflated against the first rays of sunrise your pilot will go through safety procedures. Once aloft, the balloon floats gently over the plains, giving a bird's eye view of the game below as the sun creeps slowly over the horizon. After around one hour the balloon lands as breakfast is already being prepared and, of course, enjoy a glass or two of bubbly to toast your flight in a tradition initiated by the Montgolfier brothers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lake Victoria Adventure : An early start this morning with a transfer to the airstrip for a flight by light aircraft to Lake Victoria. On arrival enjoy an appetising full English breakfast before you board the boat for the morning. There will be the opportunity to try fishing for the legendary giant Nile perch found in these waters as you explore the myriad of tiny islands in this region of the lake. An experienced and knowledgeable fisherman captains each boat. There is the chance to stop at a traditional fishing village and see how the villagers live from day to day before returning to the airstrip for your return flight to the Masai Mara.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p>";

Enjoy a full day exploring the Serengeti by 4WD vehicle with thrilling morning and afternoon game drives. Whether this is your first time on safari or a return trip the Serengeti will not disappoint.<br /><br />The Serengeti National Park is arguably the most famous national park in the world. The Serengeti perhaps defines the safari experience as surely as the wildlife that inhabits it. Established in 1951, and covering an area of almost 15,000 sq km, an area comparable to the state of Connecticut or Northern Ireland, the Serengeti hosts a fantastically diverse ecosystem. The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, where 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other plains game that follow close behind, make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";

All excursions are escorted by an experienced armed guide.<br /><br />Selous Sand Rivers is situated on the banks of the Rufiji River, offering a unique combination of adventure, comfort and exclusivity. This small luxury lodge, crafted out of local materials, comprises six individually designed cottages with en-suite bathrooms. Spaced along the river bank, each has its own private view of the wide sand-banked river with its hippos, crocodiles and birdlife.

The Selous supports around one million game animals, is bigger than Switzerland and is a World Heritage site.

Transfer from Arusha to Ngorongoro Crater Lodge located on the rim with spectacular views across the crater. The Ngorongoro Crater is the largest unbroken caldera in the world and the first sight of it is breathtaking.<br /><br />Ngorongoro Crater Lodge is situated on the edge of the ancient crater rim above the cool, swirling mists. The lodge is a return to the noble elegance of the travelling colonials. Inspired in design by the Maasai Manyatta, three separate camps of 6 to 12 suites each remember a bygone era when characters such as Lord Delamere adorned the stilted, handcrafted structures with graceful antiques, grand chandeliers and treasures collected from travels through Africa.<br /><br /></p>";

Rhinos can often be seen with calves at heel. Eland and waterbuck appear not to notice the human visitors, enabling photographers to shoot at ease. On the lake in the middle of the crater you may see thousands of flamingos fluttering and shimmering like a pink heat haze. Zebra and wildebeest account for almost half the animals.

The camp offers spectacular views across Tortillis woodland situated on the edge of the short grass plains.
