<h3><strong style="text-decoration:underline;">Singer's Tomb Unearthed in Egypt</strong></h3>
<p>A fascinating discovery in Egypt's magnificent Valley of the Kings! Archaeologists have unearthed a 3000-year-old tomb of a female singer, it is the only tomb of a woman not related to the ancient Egyptian royal families that has ever been found there, said Mansour Boraik, the top government official for the Antiquities Ministry in the city of Luxor. The coffin of the female singer, remarkably intact, is said to be Nehmes Bastet, and believed to be protected by the feline deity Bastet - seen as the defender of the pharaoh. The tomb was found by accident, according to Elina Paulin-Grothe, Field Director of the excavation at the Valley of the Kings with Switzerland's University of Basel.
Archaeologists have concluded from artifacts that she sang in the glorious Karnak Temple, one of the most famous and largest open-air sites from the Pharaonic era.</p>

<h3><strong style="text-decoration:underline;">Kunafeh is now officially part of the 'Jordan experience'</strong></h3>
<p>Confectioners report that kunafeh has become a must-buy treat for tourists when they visit Amman on account of its popularity in the Kingdom. Kunafeh is an Arabic sweet, made of very fine shreds of pastry that is layered with soft cheese and topped with sugary syrup.</p>
<p>Since the early days of modern Amman, Jordanians have become very attached to kunafeh, serving it during national celebrations and at all kinds of social events. During the 1930s, Jordanians used to prepare this dish at home, however, with the Palestinian influx after the 1948 Arab-Israeli several families arrived specialising in making kunafeh. Throughout the 40s different sweet stores opened up such as Abu Seir, Shahrazad and Habibah. Since then, these shops have attracted Jordanians and visitors alike, with various sweet offerings. And people keep coming back for more!</p>
<h3><strong style="text-decoration:underline;">Madaba prepares for Christmas</strong></h3>

<p>Madaba is a focal point for such celebrations in Jordan. Here, countless events will take place:</p>
<p>This weekend we witnessed the lighting of the Christmas Tree under the Patronage of H.E The Minister Of Tourism &amp; Antiquities and heard the Christmas Choir with Santas sing, followed by a Christmas Bazaar. Wine tastings and musical bands were also helped the crowds enter into the festive spirit.</p>
<p>More activities will take place on Friday the 16th and 23rd of December 2011 - to be announced in due course. We're already looking forward to them.</p>
<h3><strong style="text-decoration:underline;">Christmas spirit at Abercrombie &amp; Kent Jordan</strong></h3>
