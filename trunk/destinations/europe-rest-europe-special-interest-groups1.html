<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Hotel Grande Bretagne<br />

</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>ATHENS</h5>
<p>This morning a guest lecturer provides a fascinating introduction to the ancient civilisation of Greece with clear and illuminating insights into the main themes that lie behind the treasures you will be visiting on this journey.</p>
<p>
Afterwards start exploring Athens, founded in the 12th century BC and whose period of glory in the 6th and 5th centuries BC has left us with some of the world's greatest artefacts of civilisation. The highlight of the day will be a fascinating exploration of the stunning Acropolis hill, adorned with the mighty Parthenon, the Temple of Athena Nike, the Erechtheion and the Propylaia, reminders of the glory of Athens in her heyday of the 5th century BC. Complementing this visit will be a guided tour of the restored Acropolis Museum that brings together all the pieces unearthed or salvaged from the archaeological site.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Hotel Grande Bretagne   <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>ATHENS - CAPE SOUNION - ATHENS</h5>
<p>A morning at leisure to relax and stroll, or you may wish to join your local guide for a visit to the impressive Benaki Museum.</p>
<p>
This afternoon you will visit the renowned National Archaeological Museum, one of the richest and most important museums in the world, whose collection of antiquities features stunning pieces from Neolithic times through Greek civilisation to Roman art.</p>
<p>
Afterwards drive out of Athens to Cape Sounion, the sacred headland of Homer, whose delicate marble temple dedicated to Poseidon stands atop a cliff that commands the Aegean Sea. The tour has been designed specifically to ensure that you can appreciate the temple at sunset when it is at its most beautiful. Returning to Athens, dine in one of the city's fine restaurants.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Hotel Grande Bretagne  <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>ATHENS - DELPHI - KYLLINI</h5>
<p>Leave Athens this morning and drive through rugged mountain scenery along the shores of the Gulf of Corinth, arriving at the sacred religious centre of Delphi dramatically positioned on terraces against the backdrop of Mount Parnassos. Explore this extensive and fascinating archaeological site as birds of prey wheel in the clear sky above, visiting such masterpieces as the great Temple of Apollo, home of the famous oracle, the sturdy Temple of the Athenians and the extensive Ancient Theatre. Visit also the archaeological museum, a treasure trove of artefacts and boasting the Charioteer of Delphi, one of the most beautiful Greek statues from the 5th century BC.</p>
<p>
Later drive over the sweeping bridge that connects the Peloponnese peninsula to the mainland, passing olive groves and citrus plantations, and arrive the early evening at the hotel where you dine à la carte.</p>

<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,D</p>

<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>KYLLINI - OLYMPIA - NAFPLION</h5>
<p>Depart early this morning to Olympia, which enjoys a wonderful sheltered location below the wooded slopes of Mount Kronion and remains one of the most famous of ancient sites. Started in the 8th century BC and held every four years at the late summer full moon, the Games reached the height of popularity in the 5th century BC when competitors from the farthest colonies came to take part. Hostilities amongst warring factions ceased for the duration, and the athletics were complemented by great fairs and festivities.</p>
<p>
Today your local expert guide brings to life the excitement and atmosphere of the Games as you visit the remains of the enormous Temple of Zeus, the Palaestra training centre, and the stadium itself with its 630 ft running course and surviving vaulted entrance.</p>
<p>
Afterwards have lunch in a local restaurant before driving through countryside rich in agricultural produce to the delightful old town of Nafplion situated on a rocky peninsula projecting into the calm waters of the Argolic Gulf. Check into your hotel and dine tonight à la carte either inside the hotel or in one of the many restaurants in the old town.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Hotel Amphitryon<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>NAFPLION - EPIDAURUS - NAPFLION</h5>
<p> A morning at leisure to enjoy the fine facilities of the hotel or perhaps join your tour director for a walk through the charming old town of Nafplion, with its mixture of ancient Greek and Venetian influences.</p>
<p>This afternoon drive to the nearby archaeological site of Epidaurus to admire the magnificent 4th century theatre whose elegance, perfection of design and harmonious proportions made it the most famous in the ancient world. Today the theatre is beautifully preserved and retains the astonishing acoustics that enabled the actors to be heard without difficulty by 14,000 spectators. The theatre was the showpiece of a sanctuary dedicated to Aesclepius, god of medicine, and there will be time to enjoy the delightful setting of the site at leisure.</p>
<p>
Tonight enjoy dinner in one of the town's finest restaurants.</p>

<h5>NAFPLION - MYCENAE - CORINTH - ATHENS - HERAKLION - ELOUNDA</h5>
<p>Drive to Mycenae, the city "rich in gold" as described by Homer, dating from the second millennium BC and which, under the tyrannical rule of its warrior kings, gave birth to the important Mycenaen civilisation. Visit the site hewn from a rocky hill and ringed by barren mountains, with its proud Lion Gate and Royal Tombs, whose majestic beehive funerary chambers were filled with treasures.</p>
<p>
Later stop to view the extraordinary Corinth Canal, spectacularly hewn out of the rock and just wide enough for ships to pass, and afterwards enjoy a visit of the impressive remains of the acropolis of wealthy Corinth, testimony to the importance of the town as a trading centre in ancient times.</p>
<p>

<p>From about 2800 BC to 1000 BC, Crete was the centre of the brilliant Minoan civilisation. This morning, after time at leisure to relax, an invited guest speaker will outline the main themes and characteristics of this extraordinary legacy that mixed myth with historical reality.</p>
<p>
Afterwards drive to the Palace of Knossos which, according to legend, was the labyrinth of King Minos and where he kept the dreaded Minotaur, a man's body with the head of a bull, who was fed on live humans. The beautifully decorated Royal Apartments bear witness to the wealth and sophistication of this kingdom which many believe was brought to an end by a huge tidal wave caused by a volcanic eruption on nearby Santorini. Returning to the hotel, dinner this evening is at leisure.</p>

<p>A charming day spent exploring Crete, the largest island in Greece, with its wild and rugged landscape interspersed with areas of fertility and rural beauty. On this journey of discovery there will be visits to see how the old, traditional ways of making olive oil and wine are still practiced, and a chance to watch potters crafting their wares.

<h4>Day 10</h4>
<h5>RHODES TOWN</h5>
<p>In ancient times, most especially under the Romans, the island of Rhodes became the principal maritime power in the eastern Mediterranean. Later this strategically important centre was championed by the Knights of Jerusalem as the last bastion of Christianity before the Arab world, but eventually the town fell to the Turks who ruled for over four centuries. This legacy of wealth and occupation can be seen on a walking tour of the fascinating old town this morning, concentrating on the impressively walled citadel, one of the architectural masterpieces of the Mediterranean world. Visit impressive gothic buildings such as the Palace of the Grand Masters and the Knights' Hospital, and wander delightful lanes and alleys full of atmosphere and history.</p>
<p>
Returning to the hotel, the remainder of the day is at leisure to relax or you may wish to join a short cruise along the coast in a traditional caique. This evening enjoy a gastronomic farewell dinner in the hotel.</p>

<h4>Day 11</h4>
<h5>RHODES TOWN - IALISSOS - KAMIROS - EMBONA - LINDOS - RHODES TOWN</h5>
<p>According to the ancient Greeks, Rhodes is "more beautiful than the sun" and certainly the island's natural beauty has been one of its greatest assets. Today's excursion takes in the rugged and beautiful coastline of the island with some beautiful views to be enjoyed along the way. Stop at the site of the ancient city of Ialissos on the slopes of Mount Filerimos, from where a marvellous panorama of the island may be enjoyed. Continue to Kamiros, one of the three great cities of Rhodes in antiquity, where white marble ruins of Hellenistic and Roman buildings blend in with the green of the pine trees and the azure of the sea. Lunch is taken in a traditional mountain village called Embona, which has the reputation of offering the best local food and the nicest tavernas. After lunch continue on to Lindos whose fortress, towering above the town atop a sheer rock, marks the site where three civilisations have left their mark. There's time to enjoy the lively town below before perhaps joining the specialist local guide by foot to the top of the rock to admire the 20 Doric pillars that mark the site of the ancient acropolis, and the sweeping views of the island. Returning to Rhodes at the end of the afternoon, there is a farewell cocktail party at the hotel tonight before dinner at leisure.</p>

Zebra and wildebeest account for almost half the animals - gazelle, buffalo, eland, hartebeest and wart hog can also be seen.<br /></p>";

Rustic and natural, circular like an African village, its 66 rooms make up a series of rondavels. The simple style is enhanced with sophisticated detail in the form of traditional handicraft, such as wood carvings, beadwork and pottery designs. The lodge offers its own unique game trails devised in conjunction with park consultants to allow enjoyment of the Serengeti's unequalled variety of game.<br /></p>";

Whether this is your first time on safari or a return trip, the Serengeti will not disappoint.<br /><br />The Serengeti National Park is arguably the most famous national park in the world. The Serengeti perhaps defines the safari experience as surely as the wildlife that inhabits it. Established in 1951, and covering an area of almost 15,000 square kilometers, an area comparable to the state of Connecticut or Northern Ireland, the Serengeti hosts a fantastically diverse ecosystem. The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, when 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other game that follow close behind make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";
