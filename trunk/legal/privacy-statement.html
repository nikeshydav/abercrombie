<p>Abercrombie &amp; Kent India Pvt. Ltd. respects your privacy and is committed to protect the personal information that you share with us. The following policy discusses how A&amp;K manages your personal information.</p>
<h4>Your information ...</h4>
<p>A&amp;K will only collect 'Personal Information' (defined as, but not limited to, any information that identifies or can be used to identify, contact, or locate the person to whom such information pertains including, but not limited to, a first and last name, E-mail address, a home, postal or other physical address, or other contact information) that is necessary in order to provide you with the best quality product and service. The type of information we collect will depend on the circumstance of collection and on the type of product and service you request from us. These purposes include making your travel arrangements, registering to receive our newsletters, brochures or requesting information on our itineraries.</p>
<p>There may be occasions when we collect information about you from a third party, for example your travel agent who is organising your travel arrangements on your behalf. Alternatively, we may pass relevant information on to third parties such as (but not limited to) airlines, hotel partners, ground tour operators. These third parties are bound by their own set of ethics and guidelines.</p>
<h4>How do we collect information ...</h4>
<p>We collect Personal Information about you when you deal with us over the telephone, when you request information from us, send us correspondence and when you have contacted us in person.</p>
<p>When you browse the A&amp;K website www.abercrombiekent.co.in (referred to in this Statement as the 'Site') and have not registered for any online service from A&amp;K, you browse anonymously. Personal Information is not collected as you browse. A&amp;K does, however, use 'cookies,' 'client variables' and 'session variables' to collect information about how the Site and server are used and to recognize you as an A&amp;K online service user when you re-enter our Site. Information, such as the server your computer is logged onto, your browser type, and whether you entered the Site via a Web site or E-mail hyperlinks, is collected and tracked in aggregate. This information is used for the purpose of measuring response rates to the web page and e-mail hyperlinks as well as overall Site activity and performance.</p>
<p>When you register for or request any Site service, you may be asked to provide us with Personal Information which is used to enhance your Site experience, expedite communications, allow you to receive electronic/postal mailings from A&amp;K, or to be contacted as requested. Additionally, we may request your upcoming travel plans and the next destination you plan to visit which allows us to further personalise your Site and E-mail messages you may receive to meet your specific needs, as well as make A&amp;K product improvements. We may also use this Personal Information in aggregate to generate market research reports.</p>
<h4>The accuracy of your information ...</h4>
<p>A&amp;K will take all reasonable measures to ensure that the Personal Information we collect, use or disclose is accurate, relevant, up to date, complete and not misleading.<br />
We will correct any Personal Information as soon as you provide the correct information to us.</p>
<h4>The security of your information ...</h4>
<p>A&amp;K will ensure that everything possible is done to prevent unauthorised use or disclosure of your Personal Information.</p>
<h4>Our identifiers ...</h4>
<p>A&amp;K only use unique identifiers generated at random upon data entry. We do not use identifiers generated by the Commonwealth Government, Commonwealth agencies or contracted service providers.</p>
<h4>Providing your information overseas ...</h4>
<p>If you are travelling overseas, A&amp;K will disclose your Personal Information to the relevant travel suppliers. Where possible, we ensure that all our associated organisations treat your information in the same manner you would expect in India. However, you accept that some overseas suppliers may not have the equivalent privacy policies in place.</p>
<h4>Disclosing your Personal Information ...</h4>
<p>A&amp;K will not disclose your Personal Information unless the disclosure is necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the life or health of the individual concerned or another person.</p>
<p>A&amp;K will ensure that, if personal information is disclosed to a person or body that is a public sector agency, that agency does not use or disclose the information for a purpose other than the purpose for which the information was given to it.
Your information may also be shared between related companies in the Abercrombie &amp; Kent group where such disclosure is necessary to fulfill our purposes.</p>
<h4>Marketing ...</h4>
<p>A&amp;K strive to ensure that we provide the best possible product and service to our customers. From time to time, we may use Personal Information that we have collected to identify and communicate a product or service that may benefit you. We may also contact you to inform you about new, existing and improved products, services and special offers. You can always contact A&amp;K at any time if you do not want to receive marketing information.</p>
<h4>Surveys</h4>
<p>We value opinions and comments from A&amp;K customers, and you may have the opportunity to give us your feedback through surveys. In conducting these surveys, we may ask for your Personal Information so that we can appropriately identify you. Survey and Personal Information collected will be aggregated and used to make improvements to A&amp;K products and services.</p>
<p>Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose the required information.</p>
