<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 9 Nights</p>
<p>Relive the ambience of a bygone era on this journey through the riverine forests, expansive delta and spectacular game-filled bush land of Botswana. Romance is in the air - literally - when you sleep under the stars on an elevated platform and share a lantern-lit "star bath" on your private deck. The euphoria continues on a private sundowner cruise as you admire enjoy your beautiful surroundings and the array of wildlife that comes to the water's edge.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>	India/Johannesburg, South Africa</h5>
<p>On Arrival at Johannesburg, where you are met by an Abercrombie & Kent representative and taken to your hotel, set in one of the city's most exclusive residential suburbs amid lush hillside terraces and sculpted gardens. The balance of the day is at your leisure.
</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> The Westcliff Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan</strong> None
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Johannesburg/Maun, Botswana/Okavango Delta</h5>
<p>Fly to Maun and connect to your camp, located on the banks of the Boro River in the Okavango Delta. This labyrinth of waterways, wetlands and islands is an unspoiled paradise for some of Africa's greatest concentration of wildlife and birdlife. Your elegant African-themed suite is set on an elevated platform in the tree line, with a wooden deck that offers expansive views over the river and lagoon. Tonight, get close to nature - and each other - when you roll your bed onto the deck for the unique opportunity to sleep under the stars.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Sanctuary Baines' Camp <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5> Okavango Delta</h5>
<p>Game-viewing options flourish at Baines' Camp. Resting on 260,000 acres in a private concession neighboring the famed Moremi Game Reserve, the area is superb for viewing wildlife by land in open safari vehicles or on the water from a poled mokoro (dugout canoe). However, sometimes the best way to tune into the bush is on foot. Walking safaris are a specialty at your camp, and skilled guides introduce you to the area's natural wonders.

</p>
<p>
Return from a night game drive for a relaxing "star bath," a freestanding traditional Botswana-style zinc bathtub set out on your private deck, surrounded by lanterns.</p>
<p>Philanthropic Activities: During your time at Baines' you have the opportunity to participate in an educational experience with a group of semi-habituated African elephants. After a few safety tips from your mahout (trainer), you are encouraged to touch each of the elephants and lead one of them while it gently rests the tip of its trunk on your hand. You may even get a "kiss" on the cheek from one of your new friends. At a picnic spot under large shade trees, sit down and relax with cold refreshments and brunch. The elephants are fed pre-cut fodder, and you can observe them eating and playing together after their lunch.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Sanctuary Baines' Camp <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>Okavango Delta</h5>
<p>Fly to the Moremi Game Reserve and your camp, situated on the previous hunting grounds of the Batawana Tribe on Chief's Island. The camp overlooks the seasonal Piajio Channel within the Moremi Game Reserve, an area renowned for its abundant wildlife and large variety of bird life. Sanctuary Chief's Camp is made up of 12 luxury bush pavilions - each with a spacious seating area and game-viewing deck with a hammock. While you are here, take a dip in Chief's pool, pamper yourself in the spa and choose from a variety of activities that include game drives and mokoro safaris (in season).</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Sanctuary Baines' Camp <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day  5-6</h4>
<h5> Okavango Delta</h5>
<p>Game viewing in the Moremi is nothing short of spectacular. In addition to 400 species of birds, ostrich, antelope, crocodile, wildebeest, kudu and hippo are common here. However, the area has been dubbed the "predator capital" of Botswana, boasting leopard, cheetah, painted wild dog, spotted hyena and a large resident pride of lion. Game drives are conducted in custom-built open vehicles, offering an ideal viewing vantage point. While you are here, you may wish to take an optional helicopter excursion for a different perspective on the wildlife. A specially prepared romantic dinner is also in store for you during one of your evenings at Chief's.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Sanctuary Baines' Camp <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>Okavango Delta/Chobe National Park</h5>
<p>The name "Chilwero" means "place of high view" in the local Setswana language, and true to its namesake, Sanctuary Chobe Chilwero is positioned high above the Chobe River. Fly to Chobe National Park today and check in at your award-winning lodge, which offers unparalleled panoramic views across the islands and floodplains, stretching as far as Namibia. Your cottage features either a private garden or a sala (balcony) with a hammock, ideal for cuddling and casual game viewing.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Sanctuary Chobe Chilwero <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> Meals: B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 8</h4>
<h5>Chobe National Park</h5>
<p>Chobe National Park covers a diversity of landscapes, ranging from riverine forests to floodplains and periodic marshlands. The area is home to one of the largest concentration of elephants in Africa, as well as an abundance of lion, hippopotamus, buffalo, impala, puku, and a large variety of bird species. Embark on your first game drive shortly after sunrise. You can also view water-loving game up close from a different perspective when you board a small boat. End your day with a romantic couple's spa treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Sanctuary Chobe Chilwero  <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 9</h4>
<h5>Chobe National Park/Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe</h5>
<p>Travel overland this morning, crossing the border into Zimbabwe toward breathtaking Victoria Falls and your accommodations at the world-famous Victoria Falls Hotel. Built in 1904, the Victoria Falls Hotel's gracious colonial style epitomizes the romance of grand travel. Late this afternoon, set out on a private cruise on the Zambezi River aboard Ra-Ikane, a small luxury boat that reflects the ambience of a bygone era. Glide lazily down the river looking for hippo, elephant or buffalo coming to drink at the water's edge and absorb the stillness of the African bush as sunset brings the day to a close.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> The Victoria Falls Hotel <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 10</h4>
<h5>Victoria Falls/Johannesburg/Depart</h5>
<p>The final day of your adventure begins with an exclusive "Flight of Angels" that offers the amazing opportunity to travel above the majestic falls in a helicopter for unrivaled views of the crashing waters. When you are back on the ground, set out on a walking tour of Victoria Falls. Notice the permanent rainbows that crisscross the gorge, producing images that are more like paintings than reality. The unique tropical rainforest that veils the edge of the falls, the rising spray and thundering roar as these waters break against the ragged rocks below make a sight and sound never to be forgotten. Later, transfer to the airport and fly to Johannesburg for your homebound flight.</p>
<p><strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>

<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 11 Nights</p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong> From the whale-rich waters of the Drake Passage to the Antarctic Peninsula's bleach-white, remote coastlines, this comprehensive expedition cruise reveals the many faces of the world's last frontier. Explore shorelines teeming with penguin and seal alongside leading naturalists, go behind the scenes of an environmental research station and chat with on-board experts nightly about the day's discoveries.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>India/Santiago, Chile </h5>
<p>On Arrival at Santiago, where an A&K representative meets you at your gate and assists you through arrival formalities. Then transfer to your hotel, where immediate check-in has been arranged. Relax before this afternoon's optional tour of the city's highlights, including the La Moneda Palace and the Plaza de Armas. Get to know your fellow travellers this evening at a welcome cocktail party.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong>	Grand Hyatt (Santiago)<br />
<strong>Meals:</strong>		None
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5> Santiago/ Ushuaia, Argentina </h5>
<p>Today, fly to Ushuaia, the southernmost city in the world. Upon arrival, enjoy sightseeing (time permitting) and a traditional Patagonian barbecue lunch. Later, arrive at your ship and settle in for your first night on board. Only on A&K journeys to Antarctica, the passenger friendly, stylish 'Le Boreal' features all balcony staterooms and suites. Wander the decks, relax in the lounge and mingle with fellow travellers in anticipation of your voyage.
</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Le Boreal <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3-4</h4>
<h5> Cruising the Drake Passage </h5>
<p>The southward journey toward Antarctica is an exciting one. An important trade route in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the Drake Passage and its stormy waters and icy conditions often made the journey around Cape Horn a difficult one, though the stabilizer-equipped 'Le Boreal' handles it easily. The krill-rich waters are a particular favorite with marine mammals and seabirds. As you travel in the comfort of your luxury cruiser, enjoy several enriching lectures by leading experts on topics spanning Antarctica birdlife and geology to photography and history. After lunch, join your naturalists on the deck to look for various species of whale and abundant seabirds. Later this evening, chat with experts about the wildlife spotted today and discuss the next day's itinerary.
</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Le Boreal<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5-9</h4>
<h5>Antarctica</h5>
<p>As the Antarctic Peninsula and its offshore islands appear on the horizon, a sense of excitement begins to build. Day-to-day itineraries depend on the weather, water and wildlife conditions, but two excursions are carefully planned for each day by the captain and expedition leader. Each cruise day begins with an early breakfast. Afterward, venture out in swift Zodiacs, guided by expert drivers and accompanied by lecturers, to a number of sites, which may include the penguin-filled islands in the South Shetlands of Half Moon, Penguin or Deception; islands off the continental coastline such as Cuverville or Paulet; and, weather permitting, the Antarctic Peninsula. 'Le Boreal' also plans to sail through stunning Paradise Bay and the Lemaire Channel, referred to as "Kodak Alley." After a morning exploring native species and terrain, return to 'Le Boreal' for lunch. In the afternoon, set out for the day's second excursion, which may include a visit to a scientific research station and the remains of turn-of-the-century whaling and sealing stations. Return to your cruiser for cocktails and dinner. Afterward, recap the day's discoveries with your naturalist guides.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Le Boreal <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 10-11</h4>
<h5>Drake Passage </h5>
<p>The ship's return through the Drake Passage is an interlude for recap and reflection, with time to compare notes with your lecturers on the wildlife, history and geology of the White Continent. While cruising through this historic passage, you may spot whale and seabirds such as albatross and skua.

</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Le Boreal <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 12</h4>
<h5>Drake Passage </h5>
<p>'Le Boreal' docks at Ushuaia this morning, where after breakfast you bid farewell to staff and crew and disembark. Transfer to the airport to board your flight home via Santiago.</p>

<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 10 Nights</p>
<p>From the waterborne life on the winding Bangkok klongs to resort life on the island of Koh Chang, your journey to Thailand is filled with romantic sights and experiences. Gaze at tropical gardens and enjoy high tea in Bangkok, walk hand in hand through bamboo jungles and share days lounging on a secluded white sand beach or snorkeling to a hidden cove.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>India/Bangkok, Thailand</h5>
<p>On Arrival at Bangkok, Thailand's capital city, where you are met by your Abercrombie & Kent representative and provided with VIP assistance through customs and immigration procedures. Afterward, you are escorted to your hotel, set on the banks of the Chao Phraya River. At the legendary Mandarin Oriental, you can cool off in one of the lovely pools surrounded by tropical gardens, enjoy a game of squash, work out in the gym or visit the renowned spa. After having high tea in the hotel lobby lounge, the rest of the day is at your leisure.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Mandarin Oriental, Bangkok<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> None
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Bangkok</h5>
<p>As the sun rises across the river, you have the opportunity to privately make a food offering to the monks and receive a blessing of good karma in return. Afterward, travel along the river by private long-tailed boat through the busy klongs (canals) for a glimpse of the waterborne life in "the Venice of the East." Keep your eyes peeled and your camera ready as you pass by the Wat Arun (Temple of Dawn). Made of many pieces of cracked porcelain ornately carved out of sandstone, the temple seems to sparkle in the sunlight, while its rich images of demons, monkeys and guardians cast an eerie picture across the city. Disembark and go on a short ride by tuk-tuk (motorized tricycle) to the Grand Palace, one of the most beautiful examples of an ancient Siamese court. So small and distant that it can hardly be seen, little is known about the famous Emerald Buddha in sacred WatPhraKaew Temple, except that it is made of green jade or jasper and symbolizes the independence, strength and good fortune of the country. Visit the temple, whose interior walls are painted with superb frescoes. After an afternoon at leisure, you may want to take an optional sunset cocktail cruise on a local rice barge.
</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Mandarin Oriental, Bangkok<br />

<h4>Day 3-5</h4>
<h5>Bangkok/Chiang Rai</h5>
<p>Fly to remote Chiang Rai, where you are escorted to your luxurious tented camp set deep in the heart of the Golden Triangle, where Thailand, Myanmar and Laos meet. Reached only by riverboat, the camp (your home for the next three nights) features just 15 freestanding, tented rooms set comfortably apart for privacy along a hillside trail in the Thai bamboo jungle. Your relaxed days here might include learning the basic skills of a mahout (trainer) at the on-site elephant camp. You may want to take a nature walk in the jungle and then pause for a picnic lunch in your lush surroundings, or glimpse the remote villages and life along the banks of the Mekong on a river safari. Perhaps take advantage of a rejuvenating treatment for two in one of the spa's open-air salas (treatment rooms) before settling down with a cocktail as you watch the sun dip over the horizon. Dinners are always an event at your camp, and during one of the evenings of your stay, enjoy a private, romantic meal in the wine cellar.</p>

It is home to one of Thailand's most famous images: the mysterious and powerful Pra Buddha Sing (Lion Buddha). After an uphill ride along a hairpin switchback, you arrive at WatPrathat (DoiSuthep), tucked away in the mountains. Legend has it that a holy relic was placed on the back of an elephant, and where it stopped to rest, a temple would be erected.
