The sounds of civilization are soon forgotten here – only the water and the myriad sounds of the surrounding rainforest. </p>
<p>After dinner, you will have an opportunity to go for a walk into the forest to explore the mysteries of this distinctive environment and watch how life emerges in the dark. In 1541, the very first Europeans set out from Quito to explore the dense jungles east of this ancient Incan capital in search of gold and cinnamon. Not the jungle nor the natives ever revealed where the precious metal of "El Dorado" was to be found, as they floated for 800 miles down the Napo to come upon what they thought to be the Atlantic. But it wasn't the Atlantic - yet. It was the Great Amazon River, fed by over a thousand tributaries, emptying one third of the planet’s fresh water into the sea.</p>
<p>This is the habitat of wildlife that is sure to be watching you - or vice versa.</p>

<h5>QUITO–GALÁPAGOS </h5>
<p>Upon arrival at Baltra Airport, you will pass through an airport inspection point to ensure that no foreign plants or animals are introduced to the islands. You will be met by a  A&K Representative and privately transferred to the M/V Grand Odyssey, where you will check in to your cabin.</p>
<p>Visit Cerro Dragon, located at the north shore (dry landing) of Santa Cruz. The name stems from the fact that this was one of the few sites on Santa Cruz Island where a large population of land iguanas were found when researchers came in 1975. The walk includes a brackish lagoon frequented by lagoon birds, stilts, pintail ducks, sandpipers, sanderlings and occasionally flamingos. Further inland, the trail offers a stunning view of the bay and the western islands of the archipelago. This area is a natural nesting site for land iguanas, constantly monitored and aided by the Charles Darwin Research Station. </p>
<p>You will have the opportunity to swim or snorkel post the walk. </p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> M/V Grand Odyssey</p>
<p><strong>Meal: </strong>B, L, D</p>
</li>
    <li>
        <h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>GALÁPAGOS </h5>
<p>After breakfast on board, you will visit the Black Turtle Cove, which is one of the most beautiful marine sites in the Galapagos. It is a complex maze of tranquil salt-water inlets surrounded by three different species of mangrove. Its waters nurse sea turtles, rays, and sharks as well as some sea birds, which is only accessible by panga or kayak.</p>
<p>Post lunch, your destination will be Sombrero Chino Islet, the tiny island of Sombrero Chino (wet landing) gets its name from its unique appearance which is similar to that of a Chinese hat. Lying just off the southeastern tip of Santiago Island, this islet took shape fairly recently and makes for a beautiful spot for scenic photographs. You amy romance along this islet’s trail, beginning at the crescent-shaped white sandy beach offering picturesque views. The cove offers excellent swimming and snorkeling with sea lions and tropical fish in the tranquil blue waters. Kayaking is also an option.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> M/V Grand Odyssey</p>
<p><strong>Meal: </strong>B, L, D</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>GALÁPAGOS  </h5> 
<p>Today morning we stop by El Barranco, Genovesa Island. Genovesa (dry landing) is the northernmost island that is allowed to be visited by naturalist (non-diving) cruises.</p>
<p>This island is extremely remote and home to millions of birds belonging to different species including red footed boobies, frigate birds, swallow-tailed gulls, and even endemic owls. El Barranco, also known as Prince Phillip’s Steps, is a steep path (90 feet) with stairs carved into rock which leads to a plateau full of bird life amongst a Palo Santo forest. Palo Santo, paradise for a bird watcher.</p>
<p>In the afternoon the Darwin Bay’s soft, coralline white sand (wet landing) is only the beginning of a spectacular excursion. An easy stroll from the beach takes you into lush mangroves where red footed boobies nest. As you walk hand in hand you will watch thousands of birds in these mangroves. Snorkeling along the cliffs is a must here as sea lions, sharks, colourful reef fish, rays, and tortoises are common. You may also go out for a romantic paddle in a sea kayak.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> M/V Grand Odyssey</p>
<p><strong>Meal: </strong>B, L, D</p>
    </li>
    <li>
       <h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>GALÁPAGOS  </h5> 
<p>Breakfast on board, after which you land at Bartolomé Island and discover a fascinating moonscape (dry landing) dotted with volcanic formations such as lava tubes and spatter, tuff, and cinder cones — as you hike up a short, yet somewhat steep trail. </p>
<p>Along the way, you will also encounter pioneer plants, lava cactus, Scalesia plants, marine iguana and lava lizards. The sight from the top is the true reward: iconic ‘Pinnacle Rock’ next to golden beaches and turquoise waters. Returning through dunes and mangroves, we reach the north shore. Beach time is a great chance to see and perhaps snorkel with Galapagos penguins, sea turtles, sea lions, rays, and white-tipped reef sharks among a great variety of colorful schools of fish. This may be one of your best snorkeling experiences, as the water here is generally clear, lacks large surf, and is full of marine life.</p>
<p>Next stop post lunch is Sullivan Bay, a perfect place to see and feel the volcanic origin of Galápagos. You’ll arrive (wet landing) at a white coral sand beach and walk over lava that flowed here less than 100 years ago. Formed during an 1897 eruption, the lava was so hot that it essentially evaporated anything in its path, leaving only an imprint of what had been there before. It’s a stark, surreal, and strangely beautiful environment. One observer aboard a sailing vessel reported that the ship approached the lava flow so closely that the pine tar used to seal the hull of the ship began to soften, and the captain had to hurry the ship away from the bay. Snorkeling may be possible at the end of the visit.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> M/V Grand Odyssey</p>
<p><strong>Meal: </strong>B, L, D</p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>GALÁPAGOS–QUITO   </h5>    
<p>After you enjoy your breakfast, the last visit will be to the Highlands. The trail to the highlands leaves from Bellavista and passes through the agricultural zone, near the National Park boundary, the Miconia zone, and finally the fern and sedge zone. The highlands are one of the best places in the islands to observe giant tortoises in their natural habitat among some highland birds.</p>
<p>The tortoises are easy to spot as they lumber around eating grass and leaves and wallowing in the small pools that are common in the area. They have few natural enemies; humans being their principal threat. There are several lava tunnels nearby, a great place to spot the barn owl. There is also a small lagoon covered in red algae where gallinules and Galápagos pintails can be found.</p>
<p>After your visit to the highlands it will be time to depart to the airport in a private vehicle for your return flight to Quito.</p>
<p>Private transfer to your hotel and afternoon is at leisure to enjoy Quito´s colonial night.</p>

For many visitors, this may turn out to be their best snorkeling experience; the water here is generally clear, lacks large surf, and is full of marine life. Difficulty level: Moderate</p>
<p>PM: Sullivan Bay, Santiago Island <br>
This is the perfect place to see and feel the volcanic origin of Galápagos. You’ll arrive (wet landing) at a white coral sand beach and walk over lava that flowed here less than 100 years ago. Formed during an 1897 eruption, the lava was so hot that it essentially evaporated anything in its path, leaving only an imprint of what had been there before. It’s a stark, surreal, and strangely beautiful environment. One observer aboard a sailing vessel reported that the ship approached the lava flow so closely that the pine tar used to seal the hull of the ship began to soften, and the captain had to hurry the ship away from the bay. Snorkeling is possible at the end of the visit.

<h4>Day 8</h4>
<h5>Galápagos-Quito </h5>
<p>AM: Highlands, Santa Cruz Island <br>
The trail to the highlands leaves from Bellavista and passes through the agricultural zone, near the National Park boundary, the Miconia zone, and finally the fern and sedge zone.  The highlands are one of the best places in the islands to observe giant tortoises in their natural habitat.
</p>
<p>The tortoises are easy to spot as they lumber around eating grass and leaves and wallowing in the small pools that are common in the area. They can weigh between 250 and 300 kg and live up to 150-200 years.  They have few natural enemies; their principal threat has always been humans. You may also spot some highland birds such as cattle egrets, Galápagos rails, mockingbirds, finches, and vermilion flycatchers. There are several lava tunnels nearby, a great place to spot the barn owl. There is also a small lagoon covered in red algae where gallinules and Galápagos pintails can be found. </p>
<p>After your visit to the highlands it will be time to depart to the airport for your return flight to Quito.</p>
<p>Transfer to your hotel and afternoon at leisure to enjoy Quito´s colonial night. </p>

<strong>Overnight:</strong> Plaza Grande Hotel</p>
