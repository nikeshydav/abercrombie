<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 10 Nights</p>
<p>From the waterborne life on the winding Bangkok klongs to resort life on the island of Koh Chang, your journey to Thailand is filled with romantic sights and experiences. Gaze at tropical gardens and enjoy high tea in Bangkok, walk hand in hand through bamboo jungles and share days lounging on a secluded white sand beach or snorkeling to a hidden cove.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>India/Bangkok, Thailand</h5>
<p>On Arrival at Bangkok, Thailand's capital city, where you are met by your Abercrombie & Kent representative and provided with VIP assistance through customs and immigration procedures. Afterward, you are escorted to your hotel, set on the banks of the Chao Phraya River. At the legendary Mandarin Oriental, you can cool off in one of the lovely pools surrounded by tropical gardens, enjoy a game of squash, work out in the gym or visit the renowned spa. After having high tea in the hotel lobby lounge, the rest of the day is at your leisure.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Mandarin Oriental, Bangkok<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> None
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Bangkok</h5>
<p>As the sun rises across the river, you have the opportunity to privately make a food offering to the monks and receive a blessing of good karma in return. Afterward, travel along the river by private long-tailed boat through the busy klongs (canals) for a glimpse of the waterborne life in "the Venice of the East." Keep your eyes peeled and your camera ready as you pass by the Wat Arun (Temple of Dawn). Made of many pieces of cracked porcelain ornately carved out of sandstone, the temple seems to sparkle in the sunlight, while its rich images of demons, monkeys and guardians cast an eerie picture across the city. Disembark and go on a short ride by tuk-tuk (motorized tricycle) to the Grand Palace, one of the most beautiful examples of an ancient Siamese court. So small and distant that it can hardly be seen, little is known about the famous Emerald Buddha in sacred WatPhraKaew Temple, except that it is made of green jade or jasper and symbolizes the independence, strength and good fortune of the country. Visit the temple, whose interior walls are painted with superb frescoes. After an afternoon at leisure, you may want to take an optional sunset cocktail cruise on a local rice barge.
</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Mandarin Oriental, Bangkok<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3-5</h4>
<h5>Bangkok/Chiang Rai</h5>
<p>Fly to remote Chiang Rai, where you are escorted to your luxurious tented camp set deep in the heart of the Golden Triangle, where Thailand, Myanmar and Laos meet. Reached only by riverboat, the camp (your home for the next three nights) features just 15 freestanding, tented rooms set comfortably apart for privacy along a hillside trail in the Thai bamboo jungle. Your relaxed days here might include learning the basic skills of a mahout (trainer) at the on-site elephant camp. You may want to take a nature walk in the jungle and then pause for a picnic lunch in your lush surroundings, or glimpse the remote villages and life along the banks of the Mekong on a river safari. Perhaps take advantage of a rejuvenating treatment for two in one of the spa's open-air salas (treatment rooms) before settling down with a cocktail as you watch the sun dip over the horizon. Dinners are always an event at your camp, and during one of the evenings of your stay, enjoy a private, romantic meal in the wine cellar.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Four Seasons Tented Camp Golden Triangle<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>

<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>Chiang Rai/Chiang Mai</h5>
<p>Depart by private helicopter for Chiang Mai, where you check in to your resort hotel. Set in the breathtakingly beautiful Mae Rim Valley against the backdrop of the mountains, your resort is surrounded by 20 acres of landscaped tropical gardens and rice paddies. Your luxurious room has its own private outdoor sala that is ideal for absorbing the ambience and beauty of the area. This afternoon, learn how rice is grown when you join farmers in transplanting rice sprouts from the seedbed to the rice fields. Later this evening, head to Chiang Mai's famous Night Market, the largest and most colorful in Southeast Asia, to see a swirling kaleidoscope of merchants, entertainment and food carts.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Four Seasons Resort Chiang Mai <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>Chiang Mai</h5>
<p>Your day begins with a city tour of Chiang Mai, including a visit to the Waroros Market, a massive complex of stalls where you can find almost anything. Take a thrilling rickshaw ride through Chiang Mai's bustling streets to see the monastery of WatPhra Singh, passing the old city wall on the way. It is home to one of Thailand's most famous images: the mysterious and powerful Pra Buddha Sing (Lion Buddha). After an uphill ride along a hairpin switchback, you arrive at WatPrathat (DoiSuthep), tucked away in the mountains. Legend has it that a holy relic was placed on the back of an elephant, and where it stopped to rest, a temple would be erected. Sit down to a lunch of northern Thai specialties before returning to your resort.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Four Seasons Resort Chiang Mai<br />

<p><strong>Highlights:</strong> From the whale-rich waters of the Drake Passage to the Antarctic Peninsula's bleach-white, remote coastlines, this comprehensive expedition cruise reveals the many faces of the world's last frontier. Explore shorelines teeming with penguin and seal alongside leading naturalists, go behind the scenes of an environmental research station and chat with on-board experts nightly about the day's discoveries.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>India/Santiago, Chile </h5>
<p>On Arrival at Santiago, where an A&K representative meets you at your gate and assists you through arrival formalities. Then transfer to your hotel, where immediate check-in has been arranged. Relax before this afternoon's optional tour of the city's highlights, including the La Moneda Palace and the Plaza de Armas. Get to know your fellow travellers this evening at a welcome cocktail party.</p>

</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3-4</h4>
<h5> Cruising the Drake Passage </h5>
<p>The southward journey toward Antarctica is an exciting one. An important trade route in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the Drake Passage and its stormy waters and icy conditions often made the journey around Cape Horn a difficult one, though the stabilizer-equipped 'Le Boreal' handles it easily. The krill-rich waters are a particular favorite with marine mammals and seabirds. As you travel in the comfort of your luxury cruiser, enjoy several enriching lectures by leading experts on topics spanning Antarctica birdlife and geology to photography and history. After lunch, join your naturalists on the deck to look for various species of whale and abundant seabirds. Later this evening, chat with experts about the wildlife spotted today and discuss the next day's itinerary.

<li>
<h4>Day 5-9</h4>
<h5>Antarctica</h5>
<p>As the Antarctic Peninsula and its offshore islands appear on the horizon, a sense of excitement begins to build. Day-to-day itineraries depend on the weather, water and wildlife conditions, but two excursions are carefully planned for each day by the captain and expedition leader. Each cruise day begins with an early breakfast. Afterward, venture out in swift Zodiacs, guided by expert drivers and accompanied by lecturers, to a number of sites, which may include the penguin-filled islands in the South Shetlands of Half Moon, Penguin or Deception; islands off the continental coastline such as Cuverville or Paulet; and, weather permitting, the Antarctic Peninsula. 'Le Boreal' also plans to sail through stunning Paradise Bay and the Lemaire Channel, referred to as "Kodak Alley." After a morning exploring native species and terrain, return to 'Le Boreal' for lunch. In the afternoon, set out for the day's second excursion, which may include a visit to a scientific research station and the remains of turn-of-the-century whaling and sealing stations. Return to your cruiser for cocktails and dinner. Afterward, recap the day's discoveries with your naturalist guides.</p>
