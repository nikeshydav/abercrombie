<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 9 days</p>
<p>Romance, magic and mystery all make the heart beat a little faster, and Peru is the perfect location to experience all three. Entice your sense of taste when you learn to prepare, and then sample, Peruvian specialties with a cooking lesson from an experienced chef. Explore ancient Inca sites, trying to unravel their mysteries as you feel the magic of the impressive ruins and Andean landscapes; and reconnect with each other at fabulous restaurants and hotels that welcome you as if you were on your honeymoon, capping off your time with an emotional vow renewal ceremony in the mist-shrouded citadel of Machu Picchu.

 </p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>India/Lima, Peru</h5>
<p>Arrive in Lima, a city with remnants of colonial splendor and teeming vitality, where you are met and transferred to your hotel. Your romantic holiday begins the moment you check in and discover honeymoon amenities in your deluxe ocean-view suite.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Miraflores Park Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> None
</p></li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Lima</h5>
<p>This morning, meet a Lima chef and visit a local market to shop for ingredients for your cooking class. Leave the groceries in the chef's house and take a walk around the Barranco area, known for its mansions, the Bridge of Sighs and the Dedalo Art Gallery. As you stroll, your mouth waters at the thought of the delicious lunch of ceviche and tapas that you and the chef are about to prepare. When you return home, you can recreate the tempting dishes in your own kitchen and relive memories of your romantic journey. After lunch, embark on a city tour that visits the Plaza Mayor, the heart of the city and original site on which Lima was founded. Continue to the historic Cathedral, passing by the Presidential Palace and the Church of San Francisco with its library of fine paintings and frescoes. When you are ready to settle in for the night, have your private bath butler draw a steamy bath for two - an ideal way to soothe tired muscles and share memories of your exciting day.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Miraflores Park Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>Lima/Cusco/Urubamba</h5>
<p>Board a morning flight to Cusco, an Andean community and former capital of the Inca Empire. On arrival, you are transferred to Urubamba, the Sacred Valley of the Incas, and your hotel. The rest of the day is at leisure to adjust to the altitude. This evening, sit down to a special romantic dinner in the hotel and anticipate the amazing sights you are about to see over the next few days.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Hotel Rio Sagrado <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>Urubamba/Chincheros/Urubamba</h5>
<p>Chincheros is a town of Inca origin, and its colorful weekly fair draws country folk from throughout the valley to exchange goods. Wander the market today and see what treasures you may find as souvenirs. Afterward, meet Nilda Callañaupa Alvarez, a native of Chinchero. She learned to weave as a child while tending the flocks in the fields of her village and now regularly travels to the U.S. to organize weaving exhibits and workshops. View some of her work and take time to shop before you have lunch at Huayoccari Hacienda, home to an interesting collection of Colonial and folk art. After lunch, continue to the massive fortress of Ollantaytambo, a formidable stone structure that climbs massive terraces to the top of a high peak. Below the fortress lies a complete Incan town, also called Ollantaytambo, still inhabited and with its original architecture and layout preserved.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Hotel Rio Sagrado <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>Urubamba/Machu Picchu</h5>
<p>Board the deluxe Hiram Bingham train, the most luxurious way to travel the breathtaking landscape to Machu Picchu. Step on board, and you are immersed in an elegant world of polished wood, gleaming cutlery and glittering glass that evokes a romantic ambience. After a light lunch on board, arrive at the breathtaking Incan citadel and begin exploring the ruins in the company of your expert guide. Feel the pulse of this magical place as you visualize the lives of the priests, craftsmen, and servants who inhabited this seemingly uninhabitable citadel and then left, leaving no written records about its destruction. After a busy day of sightseeing, return to your beautiful mountainside retreat, high in the lush Andean clouds forest. It features the look and feel of a rural Andean village set in spectacular grounds with paths that wind past waterfalls and gardens, and trails that wander through wild forest. Snuggle under a thick alpaca blanket in your suite, which offers incredible views of the exotic gardens or the dramatic Vilcanota River.

<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>Machu Picchu/Cusco</h5>
<p>Return to Machu Picchu with your guide this morning for a final look at the ruins - and for an even more meaningful event for you. A shaman joins you to perform a vow renewal ceremony for you. Stand before the spirits of the Incas and reaffirm your love in this magical place. Afterward, return to the hotel, renewed and refreshed, for lunch. This afternoon, return to Cusco by Vista dome train and settle in at your hotel, where you receive VIP amenities.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Hotel Monasterio   <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>

<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>Cusco</h5>
<p>A morning city tour takes you to the Cathedral on the Plaza de Armas and the Santo Domingo Temple, a Dominican church and convent built on the foundations of the Koricancha (place of gold), where the Incas worshipped the sun. Continue just outside Cusco to the ruins of Sacsayhuaman, a testimonial to the Incan architectural skills. Try to slip a piece of paper between the cracks of the massive stone blocks, cut and fitted together with incredible precision without a single drop of mortar to hold them in place. Your afternoon is at leisure. Make sure to visit the hotel spa for a relaxing couple's massage. This evening, enjoy a romantic dinner at Limo restaurant, overlooking the main plaza.</p>

Enjoy a full day exploring the Serengeti by 4WD vehicle with thrilling morning and afternoon game drives. Whether this is your first time on safari or a return trip the Serengeti will not disappoint.<br /><br />The Serengeti National Park is arguably the most famous national park in the world. The Serengeti perhaps defines the safari experience as surely as the wildlife that inhabits it. Established in 1951, and covering an area of almost 15,000 sq km, an area comparable to the state of Connecticut or Northern Ireland, the Serengeti hosts a fantastically diverse ecosystem. The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, where 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other plains game that follow close behind, make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";

The Selous supports around one million game animals, is bigger than Switzerland and is a World Heritage site.

Transfer from Arusha to Ngorongoro Crater Lodge located on the rim with spectacular views across the crater. The Ngorongoro Crater is the largest unbroken caldera in the world and the first sight of it is breathtaking.<br /><br />Ngorongoro Crater Lodge is situated on the edge of the ancient crater rim above the cool, swirling mists. The lodge is a return to the noble elegance of the travelling colonials. Inspired in design by the Maasai Manyatta, three separate camps of 6 to 12 suites each remember a bygone era when characters such as Lord Delamere adorned the stilted, handcrafted structures with graceful antiques, grand chandeliers and treasures collected from travels through Africa.<br /><br /></p>";

Rhinos can often be seen with calves at heel. Eland and waterbuck appear not to notice the human visitors, enabling photographers to shoot at ease. On the lake in the middle of the crater you may see thousands of flamingos fluttering and shimmering like a pink heat haze. Zebra and wildebeest account for almost half the animals.

<h5>ITINERARY</h5>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>Welcome to Chile!</h5>
<p>Upon your arrival at Santiago airport you will receive an exclusive meet & greet at the disembarking gate of your flight. Your local A&K guide will immediately assist you with immigration and custom formalities.  Later you will be assisted to connect with your flight to Calama, the gateway of your adventure in the Atacama Desert. </p>
<p>The quaint oasis town of San Pedro de Atacama sits in the driest desert in the world – Atacama – and is the main base for explorations in the area. This region was the principal center of the Atacamanian Indian culture, and relics such as Tulor, an ancient village estimated to have been built in 800 B.C., and the superb archaeology museum boasts hundreds of artifacts that have been well preserved by the desert's arid climate. But it is perhaps San Pedro's intangible magic that captivates its visitors in the end. San Pedro's streets have a pleasant, artistic, bohemian vibe, and its adobe buildings maintain a certain charm and unique character.</p>
<p>Upon arrival at the local airport of “El Loa” in the city of Calama, you will be welcomed by your local guide from Awasi lodge, for one hour transfer to San Pedro de Atacama, where your lodge is located. </p>
<p><strong>Awasi Lodge</strong></p>
<p>Each cottage of this small hotel is tastefully appointed, with generous spaces, private patio, a reading area, as well as indoor and outdoor showers. What really sets Awasi apart from the competition is the fact that for each cottage there will be a guide and 4x4 vehicle, making for the most personalized experience for guests. The aim of Awasi is simple; provide a luxurious environment from which one can admire the immensity of the Atacama Desert, while enjoying life's creature comforts. </p>
<p>Upon arrival at the hotel, you will enjoy your lunch at the lodge and your guide will be ready to explain you the different activities available for this afternoon. </p>
<p>In the evening return to the hotel for a <strong>private candle light dinner</strong>, follow by a <strong>stargazing tour</strong> at one of the clearest sky in the world.
    The special light conditions, crystal clear atmosphere and aridness of the Atacama Desert make it one of the finest places in the world for astronomical observation. This has led to the installation of important astronomical observatories in the area in the past few years such as the ALMA Project, which will be the world’s largest radio telescope. <strong>With the help of an expert</strong>, you will learn the basic concepts and history of astronomy. You will discover the ancestral Andean culture’s interpretation of the universe and the constellations, how they measured it and the legends they created around it.
    You will also learn the difference between traditional astronomy and radio astronomy, the objectives of the ALMA</p>
<p><strong>Overnight Stay:</strong> Awasi Lodge  </p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 02 & 03</h4>
<h5>San Pedro de Atacama</h5>
<p>You will have two days at leisure at Awasi lodge to enjoy any of the daily activities available to explore the Atacama Desert. Some of the activities available at your lodge are: <br>
        <p>    <strong>Toconao and Atacama Salt Lake : -</strong></p>
        <p>Description: The car leaves Awasi heading south on the paved road to the Salt Lake. After some 60 minutes we reach the town of Toconao, famous for its buildings of liparite volcanic stone. There, you can visit its historic church and bell tower and tour the stalls of craftspeople who offer their goods in the square. Next to Toconao is Jere creek, a canyon with the only running fresh water in these surroundings. This water has fed, since long ago, a true orchard of fruit trees and farmed vegetables. Then, continue on to Chaxa pond, a National Reserve located at Atacama Salt Lake. This pond is surrounded by salt crusts that result from the evaporation of salty ground water. In this setting you may observe the flamingoes that inhabit the Salt Lake, as well as other native bird species. This is undoubtedly a place of captivating beauty from which you can see the Domeyko Range, the Salt Range and the Andes Range, a panorama that becomes particularly splendid at dusk.</p>
<p>The ALevel of difficulty: Easy. <br>
       	What to bring along: Sunscreen, sun glasses; if the outing is in the afternoon: Windbreaker, full shoes (for all).<br>
	Departure: Morning or afternoon.<br>
Van trip: 80 miles (round trip).Duration: 4 hours approx.


</p>
<p><strong>Moon Valley </strong></p>
<p>Description: Leave Awasi and head to the Natural Reserve, which is located some 15 minutes away in the middle of the Salt Range. Its name speaks of the magic of the landscape. As the tour progresses, you find lookouts from which to observe the unusual geological shapes which, together with the action of wind and water, have originated a land relief reminiscent of the inhospitable beauty of the lunar surface. The final moments of the sunset when, in a matter of seconds, luminous streaks bring out subtle coloring differences in the mountains, is simply indescribable.
Level of difficulty: Easy.
What to bring along: Sunscreen, sun glasses, hiking shoes.
Departure: In the afternoon.
Van trip: 25 miles (round trip).
Duration: 3,5 hours approx.
</p>
<p><strong>Cejar Pond</strong></p>
<p>Description: Leave Awasi by car and head to the northern part of the Atacama Salt Lake, crossing part of the Ayllu that are farthest from San Pedro, and then turn into a dirt road surrounded by sparse vegetation and remarkable dryness. After some 11 miles reach Cejar, a set of three ponds located in the middle of the Salt Lake in one of which you can bathe. Given its high degree of saltiness, you can not only float on the water but in fact cannot sink, a phenomenon similar to what you find in the Dead Sea (Israel). In this place you can watch birds that live in the Salt Lake zone, such as flamingoes and Andean gulls, and enjoy a privileged view of the surrounding ranges whose color contrasts with the deep blue of its waters. This outing is also optional on bicycle, a ride that takes approximately 1 hour and a half, returning to the Hotel by car.
Level of difficulty: Easy.
What to bring along: Sunscreen, sun glasses, bathing suit, sandals.
Departure: Morning or afternoon.
Van trip: 23 miles (round trip).
Duration: 3 hours approx.
</p>
<p><strong>Highland Salt Lakes </strong></p>
<p>Description: Highly recommendable, as there are few places in the highlands which offer such a variety. Leave Awasi heading south and visit the towns of Toconao and Socaire (10.600 ft). Along the way you will find different types of landscapes, which run from the driest dessert to small oases and mountain views. You will be able to see vicunas, among other wild species. You will be surprised by the immensity and inhospitable beauty of the Tuyajtu and Aguas Calientes salt lakes, with their turquoise colored ponds inhabited by ducks and flamingoes.
Level of difficulty: Easy, but requires prior adaptation to the altitude.
What to bring along: Sunscreen, sun glasses, warm clothing (jacket, long pants, full shoes, hat).
Departure: Morning
Van trip: 200 miles (round trip).
Duration: Full day.
</p>
<p><strong>Tatio- Puritama</strong></p>
<p>Description: We head north and gradually gain altitude as you cross the highland and observe the very rich flora & fauna of the place. After two hours on the road reach the Tatio Geysers, intermittent springs that gush out as imposing steam and hot water columns. After visiting the place you will have breakfast, enjoying the place and the peculiarity of its fumaroles. Before returning to Awasi, stop at the Puritama warm springs, where you can bathe and enjoy an appetizer (see Puritama).
Level of difficulty: Easy, but requires prior adaptation to the altitude.
What to bring along: Sunscreen, sun glasses, lots of warm clothing (jacket, long pants, full shoes, hat).
Departure: 6:00 / Return: 12:00pm
Van trip: 157 miles (round trip).

</p>
<p>During your stay in Atacama, enjoy an exciting experience surfing in the dunes of San Pedro de Atacama. Sanboard is a great experience not just because of the place, but also due to the strong feeling that you will get when you are going down in a dunes of 120 metres.  </p>

<p><strong>Overnight Stay:</strong> Awasi Lodge  </p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 04</h4>
<h5>Calama  Santiago-Wine Country</h5>
<p>After a leisure breakfast at your lodge, you will be transferred back to the airport in Calama to return to Santiago. </p>
<p>Upon arrival in Santiago, your A&K local guide will meet you at the airport to continue your trip and explore some of the<strong> best Chile's wine valleys.
        Casablanca</strong> is one of the most emblematic valleys on Chile's wine circuit and provides an enticing mix of some of the country's finest whites like Loma Larga wines. We invite you to<strong> discover Loma Larga</strong> peaceful vineyard's area and its beautiful old parks before an exclusive wines tasting on the country-state house.
    Then you will continue to the San Antonio valley, Chile's newest and smallest D.O. and home to several new vineyards, such as <strong>Matetic vineyard.</strong></p>
<p>The Matetic family owns the entire Rosario valley Estate, which has a luxurious but rustic-looking guesthouse at one end, an impressive, hi-tech bodega at the other. The family history starts in Punta Arenas, at the end of the 19th century, with the arrival to Chile of Jorge Matetic Cetinja. Armed with a tremendous spirit of adventure, this Croatian immigrant sailed from Europe to settle in the far southern part of America. This same spirit of adventure is what led the company into the wine-growing business in 1999, in the firm belief that climatic characteristics associated with the kind of soil and light in this part of the country could produce high quality wines. How correct they were. Due to its geographic location, its temperate coastal Mediterranean climate has a strong ocean influence, with significant thermal fluctuations during the day - 20 degrees in the ripening period. The temperature normally rises quickly during the morning, until noon, when a soft ocean breeze helps maintain an average 26 degrees during the summer, a temperature that is ideal for the ripening of grapes. </p>
<strong>. Enjoy a private wine tasting before an exquisite lunch on the winery's restaurant.</strong>
<p>The rest of the afternoon is at leisure to enjoy the beautiful garden of the vineyard.

Dinner will be served at your lodge “La Casona of Vineyard Matetic”

<p>The hotel is located in the converted “Frigorific Puerto Bories”, a post-Victorian cold-storage plant built in 1915. This industrial complex was originally built by the “Sociedad Explotadora de Tierra del Fuego” to process and export frozen meat to Europe. The cattle came from all over the Patagonia, including across the Andes in Argentina. The factory was in operation for 70 years, generating work and contributing to the development of the region. After a long period of neglect, the building was restored to its former industrial grandeur and as a result of the meticulous conservation, was declared a National Monument in 1996.</p>

<h5>Santiago / Easter Island </h5>
<p>In due to time, departure transfer for your hotel to the airport in Santiago to board your flight to Easter Island. </p>
<p>Discovered in 1722 on Easter Sunday (hence the name), Easter Island is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the most isolated place on the face of the Earth. At a distance of 3,700 km (2,300 miles) from the nearest populated point, which is the Chilean mainland. Although more Polynesian than South American in character, the 64-square mile island was annexed by Chile in 1888, and is now famous as the world’s largest ‘open air Museum’ on account of the Moai, or human-like stone statues, (more than 600 of them), that can be found on the island.  The Moai remain very much a mystery which archaeologists are still trying to unlock by interpreting an ancient language of the Rapa Nui, which is the key to understanding this culture, and is written on the so called ‘rongo rongo tablets’. However, its unique characters that run left-to-right one line and then the reverse on the next line are still undecipherable. </p>
<p>The island owes its origin to three volcanoes which erupted some three million years ago: Poike, Rano Kau and Maunga Terevaka. It is not known when or how the island was first populated, but the most credible theory suggests that the Rapa Nui people came from other Pacific islands in the 4th century AD.
In addition to the cultural and archaeological interest, there are the beautiful beaches, transparent waters and coral reefs that might be expected of a Pacific Island, and Jacques Cousteau himself agreed that it is one of the most perfect places for under-water marine studies.

Upon arrival to the local airport Mataveri, you will be welcomed with traditional floral collars and transfer to Explora Lodge, Posada Mike Rapu.
</p>

<p><strong>Explora Lodge, Posada Mike Rapu.</strong></p>

The hotel is situated in the southwestern zone of the island, 5.6 km from Hanga Roa – the only town on the island – and it will act as a base for exploring this attractive and mysterious island, home to a culture whose origins and evolution remain unexplained. Volcanic rocks, native to the island and always used by the island’s inhabitants in construction, and wood from the mainland are the principal materials. The hotel has 30 guestrooms that spread out from central areas that house reception, living areas, a bar, kitchen and services. Next to the common areas is the “Casa de Baños” Hare Vai, with a pool, massage salon and open-air Jacuzzis.</p>

This<strong> afternoon your local A&K guide will assist you to dress your self as the local Rapa Nui People due, using the traditional body painting known as “Takona”</strong>. During traditional ceremonies Rapa Nui people paint their faces and bodies preserving the technique of mixing natural pigments and describing the meaning of the painting.  </p>
<p><strong>A sunset champagne toast will specially set atone of the amazing spot of the island.</strong> In the evening <strong>enjoy your dinner at the home of local Rapa Nui family.</strong> The key to understanding the history, myths and legends of this extraordinary place is surely meeting their people. Dining at the home of a local family, providing an unforgettable experience and true insight on everyday life on the island. This evening you will have the opportunity to savor the most typical Rapa Nui and Polynesian food, prepared in an earth-oven, locally called <strong>“UMU”.</strong> The curanto, or “UMU”, will be<strong> prepared by Maria Huke Rapahango,</strong> the matriarch of the family that will look after you during the dinner.

Enjoy a full day exploring the Serengeti by 4WD vehicle with thrilling morning and afternoon game drives. Whether this is your first time on safari or a return trip the Serengeti will not disappoint.<br /><br />The Serengeti National Park is arguably the most famous national park in the world. The Serengeti perhaps defines the safari experience as surely as the wildlife that inhabits it. Established in 1951, and covering an area of almost 15,000 sq km, an area comparable to the state of Connecticut or Northern Ireland, the Serengeti hosts a fantastically diverse ecosystem. The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, where 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other plains game that follow close behind, make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";

The Selous supports around one million game animals, is bigger than Switzerland and is a World Heritage site.

Transfer from Arusha to Ngorongoro Crater Lodge located on the rim with spectacular views across the crater. The Ngorongoro Crater is the largest unbroken caldera in the world and the first sight of it is breathtaking.<br /><br />Ngorongoro Crater Lodge is situated on the edge of the ancient crater rim above the cool, swirling mists. The lodge is a return to the noble elegance of the travelling colonials. Inspired in design by the Maasai Manyatta, three separate camps of 6 to 12 suites each remember a bygone era when characters such as Lord Delamere adorned the stilted, handcrafted structures with graceful antiques, grand chandeliers and treasures collected from travels through Africa.<br /><br /></p>";
