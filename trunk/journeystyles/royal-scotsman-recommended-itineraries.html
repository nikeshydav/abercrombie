    <h3>Detailed Itinerary</h3>
    <h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>ARRIVE KEITH</h5>
<p>Early this afternoon, board the Belmond Royal Scotsman, the luxury train travelling through the Scottish Highlands. From Edinburgh's Waverley Station you travel northwards across the Firth of Forth passing the cantilever Forth Railway Bridge, a celebrated Scottish landmark. The Forth Railway Bridge is considered as a milestone in the development of railway civil engineering, and known as the eighth wonder of the world.
</p>
<p>Spend a leisurely afternoon, relaxing over a cup of tea as you pass through Arbroath, Montrose and Aberdeen. After your arrival in Keith, end your day with an informal dinner followed by an overnight stabling.
</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Belmond Royal Scotsman<br />
<strong>Meal plan:</strong> D</p>
</li>
    <li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>KYLE OF LOCHALSH</h5>
<p>Begin the day with a leisurely breakfast aboard the train. Depart Keith and travel westwards to Inverness, the beautiful capital of the Highlands. Travel on to Muir of Ord, where you disembark to visit Glen Ord Distillery, the only remaining single malt Scotch whisky distillery on the Black Isle.
</p>
<p>Return to the train for lunch onboard. Travel along one of the most scenic routes in Britain en route for Kyle of Lochalsh, a village on the northwest coast of Scotland. The line passes Loch Luichart and the Torridon mountains, which are so old that they contain no fossils. Geologists believe that they were formed before any life began. 
</p>
<P>Pass by Achnasheen, ascending towards Luib summit and Achnashellach forest, later descending to Strathcarron. Your train journey traces the edge of Loch Carron through Attadale, Stromeferry and Duncraig. </P>
<P>Arriving at Plockton, you have the opportunity to self-explore this charming Scottish Highland village. Further, take a boat trip to observe the colony of wild seals, while you take in the splendid views across the Isle of Skye to the Applecross Mountains. Cross by a woodland walk, leading to a viewpoint overlooking the loch. Alternatively, you could visit the local art gallery or simply meander through this charming village. Later, rendezvous at the Plockton Hotel; where there is time to enjoy a dram or two before rejoining the motorcoach.</P>
<P>Return to the train in Kyle of Lochalsh for your overnight stabling.</P>
<P>This evening, enjoy a formal dinner and afterwards there is entertainment in the Observation Car. Marvel at the view from the train's verandah as you gaze over Loch Alsh to the Isle of Skye.
</P>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Belmond Royal Scotsman<br />
<strong>Meal plan:</strong> B, L, D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>BOAT OF GARTEN</h5>
<p>This day, after breakfast, you may choose to visit Eilean Donan Castle before the train heads north to Inverness. Further, travel southwards to Carrbridge, disembark here for your visit to Ballindalloch, one of Scotland's most romantic castles with magnificent gardens surrounded by the wonderful Spey valley.
</p>
<p>Later, return to the train in Boat of Garten on the private Strathspey Railway for overnight stabling. </p>
<P>Begin the evening with an informal dinner followed by an interactive session with a Highlander, who brings to life the stories of Scottish heroes. Gain a true sense of the past and learn how life in the Highlands has changed over the centuries.</P>
