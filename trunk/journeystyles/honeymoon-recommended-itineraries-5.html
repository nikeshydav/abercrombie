<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 7 Days</p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong> Enjoy Rio de Janeiro sightseeing & cable car ride up Sugar Loaf Mountain & train to Corcovado summit. Top properties in each city: The best boutique hotel in Rio, the best beach resort in Brazil.</p>
</li>
<h5>ITINERARY</h5>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>Arrive Rio de Janeiro / Sugar Loaf</h5>
<p>Welcome to Rio de Janeiro, the city of mountains and sea, samba and carnival, and a relaxed way of life. You are transferred to your hotel along Copacabana Beach. This afternoon, your orientation begins with a cable car ascent of Sugar Loaf Mountain, a tour of city sights, and a ride along the world-famous beaches. Bottle of champagne in the room to celebrate your first night in Rio.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Fasano, Rio De Janeiro</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Rio de Janeiro / Corcovado & Lunch at Confeitaria Colombo</h5>
<p>This morning, the breakfast will be served in the room. You will be taken to one of Wonders of the World: The statue of Christ the Redeemer, which crowns the top of the Corcovado mountain with stunning views of Guanabara Bay, Sugar Loaf and the beaches of Copacabana and Ipanema below. The perfect way to reach the summit is on the toy train which zig zags its way up through the lush rainforest of the Tijuca Forest where it is possible see monkeys and parrots in the trees. Once on top you will have ample time to admire the views. You will have lunch at Confeitaria Colombo, a 100 year old Tea Room / Restaurant (closed on Saturdays afternoon, Sundays and public holidays) that has been kept in pristine conditions and it is a pleasure to enjoy. It is one of the most traditional restaurants in Rio and it is part of the city's cultural heritage.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Fasano, Rio De Janeiro</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>Rio de Janeiro / Samba Class & Shall we dance</h5>
<p>Samba Dance Class at the prestigious dancing school of Carlinhos de Jesus. Rio de Janeiro is the birthplace of samba. It's impossible to resist the most Brazilian of all beats. You listen to it, and before you notice your feet are tapping, your fingers snapping! If only you knew how to dance it the way locals do... Well, you can. With a 2-hour lesson you'll be ready to do the basic samba steps and body movements, and before you know it you will be dancing really well! Tonight dinner will be at Rio Scenarium which if there was an award for most beautiful bar, it would certainly deserve it. Located in a renovated warehouse on the edge of Lapa, it is an antique store-turned-bar which serves a wide range of seafood and traditional Brazilian dishes. There is also a stage on the main floor where live Brazilian samba and choro bands will be playing as well as dance floor in case you want to samba the night away. This is the perfect place to practice the moves you learnt earlier today.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Fasano, Rio De Janeiro</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>Rio de Janeiro-Florianopolis</h5>
<p>Morning at leisure to relax on the beach or linger at sidewalk cafes or take in an optional tour. In the afternoon, fly to Florianopolis. Upon arrival at Florianopolis airport, you will be met by your guide who will take you to paradise. The destination is "Ganchos". That's how it was baptized by its founders: Azorean immigrants who settled on this lush, mountainous, cove-studded peninsula, more than two hundred years ago at the height of the whaling boom. Some decades ago, the small city was renamed as Governador Celso Ramos. Protected from people's curiosity as by its topography, Ganchos has to this day remained one of the last surviving secrets of the Brazilian coast.</p>
<p>More than just natural beauty, a whole way of life has been preserved here. The colonists descendants still make their living from the sea – nowadays cultivating oysters, scallops and other shellfish.</p>
<p>You leave the main road behind and eight miles further on you find yourself winding along through a succession of villages strung along the north-facing peninsula as though frozen in time. Slow down. The coast road passes hard by the picturesque colonial style houses, as calm little bays come into view one by one, the water dotted with the simple boats and mollusk farmers colored buoys.</p>
<p>At the end of an unassuming lane, a gate will open to reveal the most amazing spot on the whole peninsula.</p>
<p>Welcome to Ponta dos Ganchos.</p>
<p>Be warned in advance: it’s not easy to leave the bungalow. Well, of course, the instant you call for one, an electric car will appear at your door in a flash. Nevertheless, sometimes it is going to be difficult to want to leave.<br>
It might be because of the therapeutic mattress or perhaps, it is because there are just too many threads in the Egyptian cotton sheets. Sometimes the espresso machine or the organic snacks next to it in the mini-bar are to blame.<br>
Other times it will be a combination of things – your private wine cellar will join forces with the view of the sunset over the bay to prevent you from venturing beyond the terrace. This is the reason why breakfast is like a miniature gourmet festival – a parade of delicacies served in dainty portions. Providing a little competition for the terrace of your bungalow is a little stone island just in front of the beach that you can reach swimming or along a catwalk.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Ponta dos Ganchos, Florianopolis</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>Ponta Dos Ganchos - Governador Celso Ramos</h5>
<p>Once you've become accustomed to the idea that the bungalows, with its creature comforts and its view, is always going to be there waiting for you, you will become more enthusiastic about venturing out. There is a wide selection of short trips, lasting from a couple of hours to a whole afternoon and that don’t involve leaving the peninsula. or going too far away from your whirlpool bath.<br>
A quick chat with the concierge will provide you with enough activity choices to keep you busy for this visit such as: visit to oyster farm, a walk along deserted beaches, a visit to the dolphins, beaches and forest on horseback, trip to waterfall by bike, diving with biodiversity, sport fishing and more.<br>
All activities are optional and not included in the program.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Ponta dos Ganchos, Florianopolis</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>Ponta Dos Ganchos - Governador Celso Ramos</h5>
<p>Day at leisure.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Ponta dos Ganchos, Florianopolis</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>Governador Celso Ramos</h5>
<p>Around noon you will be taken back to Florianopolis airport for your flights back home.</p>

Tango is not only a dance but also an obsession. For the ´tanguero´, it is as much as a part of life as eating and sleeping. Erotic and passionate, haunting and melancholic, it involves not only the body but also the soul. Yes, it is just feeling - but in one dance, you can express sad, happy, angry, relax, deep, shallow, cheerful, sorrow, painful, serious, intellectual or just playful feelings. Tango has captured the popular imagination for over one hundred years to become no less than an international cult.</p>

Leave the groceries in the chef's house and take a walk around the Barranco area, known for its mansions, the Bridge of Sighs and the Dedalo Art Gallery. As you stroll, your mouth waters at the thought of the delicious lunch of ceviche and tapas that you and the chef are about to prepare. When you return home, you can recreate the tempting dishes in your own kitchen and relive memories of your romantic journey.

Continue to the historic Cathedral, passing by the Presidential Palace and the Church of San Francisco with its library of fine paintings and frescoes.

After a light lunch on board, arrive at the breathtaking Incan citadel and begin exploring the ruins in the company of your expert guide. Feel the pulse of this magical place as you visualize the lives of the priests, craftsmen, and servants who inhabited this seemingly uninhabitable citadel and then left, leaving no written records about its destruction. After a busy day of sightseeing, return to your beautiful mountainside retreat, high in the lush Andean clouds forest. It features the look and feel of a rural Andean village set in spectacular grounds with paths that wind past waterfalls and gardens, and trails that wander through wild forest.
