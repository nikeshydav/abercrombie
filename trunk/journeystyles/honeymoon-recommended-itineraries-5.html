Enjoy a full day exploring the Serengeti by 4WD vehicle with thrilling morning and afternoon game drives. Whether this is your first time on safari or a return trip the Serengeti will not disappoint.<br /><br />The Serengeti National Park is arguably the most famous national park in the world. The Serengeti perhaps defines the safari experience as surely as the wildlife that inhabits it. Established in 1951, and covering an area of almost 15,000 sq km, an area comparable to the state of Connecticut or Northern Ireland, the Serengeti hosts a fantastically diverse ecosystem. The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, where 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other plains game that follow close behind, make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";

The Selous supports around one million game animals, is bigger than Switzerland and is a World Heritage site.

Transfer from Arusha to Ngorongoro Crater Lodge located on the rim with spectacular views across the crater. The Ngorongoro Crater is the largest unbroken caldera in the world and the first sight of it is breathtaking.<br /><br />Ngorongoro Crater Lodge is situated on the edge of the ancient crater rim above the cool, swirling mists. The lodge is a return to the noble elegance of the travelling colonials. Inspired in design by the Maasai Manyatta, three separate camps of 6 to 12 suites each remember a bygone era when characters such as Lord Delamere adorned the stilted, handcrafted structures with graceful antiques, grand chandeliers and treasures collected from travels through Africa.<br /><br /></p>";

Rhinos can often be seen with calves at heel. Eland and waterbuck appear not to notice the human visitors, enabling photographers to shoot at ease.

With a 2-hour lesson you'll be ready to do the basic samba steps and body movements, and before you know it you will be dancing really well! Tonight dinner will be at Rio Scenarium which if there was an award for most beautiful bar, it would certainly deserve it.

<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Fasano, Rio De Janeiro</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>Rio de Janeiro-Florianopolis</h5>
<p>Morning at leisure to relax on the beach or linger at sidewalk cafes or take in an optional tour. In the afternoon, fly to Florianopolis. Upon arrival at Florianopolis airport, you will be met by your guide who will take you to paradise. The destination is "Ganchos". That's how it was baptized by its founders: Azorean immigrants who settled on this lush, mountainous, cove-studded peninsula, more than two hundred years ago at the height of the whaling boom. Some decades ago, the small city was renamed as Governador Celso Ramos. Protected from people's curiosity as by its topography, Ganchos has to this day remained one of the last surviving secrets of the Brazilian coast.</p>
<p>More than just natural beauty, a whole way of life has been preserved here. The colonists descendants still make their living from the sea – nowadays cultivating oysters, scallops and other shellfish.</p>
<p>You leave the main road behind and eight miles further on you find yourself winding along through a succession of villages strung along the north-facing peninsula as though frozen in time. Slow down. The coast road passes hard by the picturesque colonial style houses, as calm little bays come into view one by one, the water dotted with the simple boats and mollusk farmers colored buoys.</p>
<p>At the end of an unassuming lane, a gate will open to reveal the most amazing spot on the whole peninsula.</p>
<p>Welcome to Ponta dos Ganchos.</p>
<p>Be warned in advance: it’s not easy to leave the bungalow. Well, of course, the instant you call for one, an electric car will appear at your door in a flash. Nevertheless, sometimes it is going to be difficult to want to leave.<br>
It might be because of the therapeutic mattress or perhaps, it is because there are just too many threads in the Egyptian cotton sheets. Sometimes the espresso machine or the organic snacks next to it in the mini-bar are to blame.<br>
Other times it will be a combination of things – your private wine cellar will join forces with the view of the sunset over the bay to prevent you from venturing beyond the terrace. This is the reason why breakfast is like a miniature gourmet festival – a parade of delicacies served in dainty portions. Providing a little competition for the terrace of your bungalow is a little stone island just in front of the beach that you can reach swimming or along a catwalk.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Ponta dos Ganchos, Florianopolis</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>Ponta Dos Ganchos - Governador Celso Ramos</h5>
<p>Once you've become accustomed to the idea that the bungalows, with its creature comforts and its view, is always going to be there waiting for you, you will become more enthusiastic about venturing out. There is a wide selection of short trips, lasting from a couple of hours to a whole afternoon and that don’t involve leaving the peninsula. or going too far away from your whirlpool bath.<br>
A quick chat with the concierge will provide you with enough activity choices to keep you busy for this visit such as: visit to oyster farm, a walk along deserted beaches, a visit to the dolphins, beaches and forest on horseback, trip to waterfall by bike, diving with biodiversity, sport fishing and more.<br>
All activities are optional and not included in the program.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Ponta dos Ganchos, Florianopolis</p>

<p>This tour will allow you to learn about the main tendencies in Argentine and Latin American art, visiting tree of the most exciting museums in town: the National Museum of Fine Arts, the Latin American Arts Museum and the Quinquela Martín Museum.</p>
<p>The National Museum of Fine Arts (MNBA) houses a vast collection of 11,000 pieces, between canvases, sculptures, tapestry, engravings, drawings and objects, and possesses a small but precious European art collection, with works by Corot, Manet,
Boudin, Cézanne, Renoir, Toulouse-Lautrec and Rodin. But this time we‟ll pay special attention to the Argentine art section, which houses pieces by Morel, Pueyrredon, Lopez, Sívori, De la Cárcova, Fader and Quiroz, among others.</p>
<p>
The modern, state-of-the-art Museum of Latin American Art in Buenos Aires (MALBA) was built by Cordoba based architects Gaston Atelman, Martin Fourcade and Alfredo Tapia. MALBA is a space devoted to the collection, conservation, study and divulgation of Latin American art from the early 20th century to the present. Some of the artists in permanent exhibition are Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera, Antonio Berni, Pedro Figari, Xul Solar, Guillermo Kuitca, among others.
</p>
<p>Also, in the green corridor between the MNBA and the MALBA, we‟ll be able to see many statues and monuments that grace our parks. Near the MALBA we can find the impressive Floralis Generica, a mechanical flower built in aluminum and steel, designed by Argentine architect Eduardo Catalano, which imitates the life cycle of a true flower, opening during the day and closing by night.</p>
<p>Ending our visit, we travel to the working-class port district of La Boca, where we visit the Benito Quinquela Martín Museum. Donated by the artist himself in 1933, this museum hosts a great part of his work, which depicts the life of the neighborhood and its inhabitants.</p>

<p>Evening,enjoy Dinner and <strong>Tango Show at Esquina Carlos Gardel</strong></p>
<p>Buenos Aires is the birthplace of Tango, born in the brothels of the city, just before the beginning of the 1880s century. The word' Tango" refers to both a musical style and the dance performed to it. Tango, a dance known as passionate, sensual and very elegant, was all the rage in the 1930's in Buenos Aries and Paris. Tango is not only a dance but also an obsession. For the ´tanguero´, it is as much as a part of life as eating and sleeping. Erotic and passionate, haunting and melancholic, it involves not only the body but also the soul. Yes, it is just feeling - but in one dance, you can express sad, happy, angry, relax, deep, shallow, cheerful, sorrow, painful, serious, intellectual or just playful feelings. Tango has captured the popular imagination for over one hundred years to become no less than an international cult.</p>
