    <h5>Detailed Itinerary</h5>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>ARRIVE DENPASAR–SINGARAJA–Day at Leisure</h5>
<p>Upon arrival at Ngurah Rai International Airport, Denpasar you will be greeted by your A&K Representative and transferred by a private vehicle to Singaraja, among the paddy fields and hills of this lush Indonesian island.</p>
<p>Afternoon, relax at the resort which offers spectacular views across the northern coast valley to the Java Sea. Resort is set within a coffee plantation which is largely unexplored offering stunning view of the picturesque landscape, organic meals and tranquil surroundings. Celebrate the onset of your honeymoon with champagne by your private heated pool or sip on the famous coffee "kopi luak". </p>
<p>A candlelit dinner tonight will be a choice of delectable dishes of authentic Indonesian cuisine served by a private butler in a private bale bengong with unhindered views of the skyline.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Munduk Moding Coffee Plantation </p>
<p><strong>Meal Plan: </strong>B, D </p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>SINGARAJA–Banjar Hot Springs, organic lunch and spa</h5>
<p>After breakfast, you will leave in a private vehicle to the Banjar Hot Springs, located in Banjar countryside, close to the Wihara (Buda Temple). The hot wellspring source is probably hundreds years old and after the Japanese colonized Indonesia, it was developed into three pools to relocate the water for taking a bath. It is believed that having bath in the brimstone heated water is therapeutic and skin diseases heal. One may even enjoy the hot water fall, which has the ability to make the body feel revitalized and stress-free.  </p>
<p>Return to the plantation for a scrumptious organic authentic lunch.</p>
<p>After lunch, take a relaxing private Balinese couple spa, surrounded by the plantation. Unwind your body and soul, with the intoxicating scent of flowers and spices. The tranquil sound of water as it trickles down a rock clad wall will soothe your mind.</p>
<p>Dinner will be organised at the plantation.
</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong>Munduk Moding Coffee Plantation</p>
<p><strong>Meal Plan: </strong>B, L, D </p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>SINGARAJA–UBUD–Sightseeing of plantations, Buyan and Tamblingan lakes & Jatiluwih</h5>
<p>Munduk is an ideal location for outdoor activities. This morning you’ll have the opportunity to explore the Coffee & Clove Plantations – learning about the plantation and processing methodologies. After this short trip, you will be transferred in a private vehicle along with a private guide south to a vantage point overlooking two superb volcanic lakes: Buyan and Tamblingan. </p>
<p>Take a horse ride to explore the tropical rain forest, hillside area and volcanic lake along with your private guide. The short excursion includes a private boat trip with a traditional dugout at the serene Tamblingan Lake. Enjoy the picturesque backdrop while riding, en-route visit the village of Bedugul. Further ahead you will visit the major water temple of Pura Ulun Danu, founded in the 17th century; perhaps one of the most photographed temples in Bali.

This was formerly the seat of power for the once enormous and glorious Khmer empire through the 9th and 15th centuries AD. The architecture of this town is distinctly colonial and Chinese, which originated from a cluster of old villages, but today is alive with culture, restaurants and pubs.</p>
<p>Amansara was originally the guesthouse of King Sihanouk, built by French architect is situated on the edge of Siem Reap.

</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>SIEM REAP–Visit Angkor Thom, Bayon Temple & Tonle Sap Lake </h5>
<p>Enjoy a spectacular and a life time experience of viewing the sunrise at Angkor Wat with Champagne breakfast at Ta Lek gate. Angkor Thom, the heavily fortified city built in the 10th century by the greatest of the Khmer rulers, King Jayavarman VII (1181 - 1201). With a population in excess of one million inhabitants, Angkor Thom covered an area of 10 square kilometers and was larger than any city in Europe at the time.</p>
<p>From Angkor Thom's southern gateway, continue to visit the Bayon Temple riding on an elephant back while you explore the temple along with your private guide. The structure is overwhelming in its construction and most Angkor specialists agree that it is one of the finest examples of classic Khmer architecture. This temple marks the exact centre of Angkor Thom, thus it is the most recognized of the city's temples and also the most enigmatic and mysterious. </p>
<p>As you exit the Bayon Temple take a brief halt at the Royal Enclosures to see the Elephant Terrace. The terrace takes its name from the extraordinary representation of elephants and of an elephant hunt, which takes up the majority of the frieze. A little north of the main terrace is another, known as the Terrace of the Leper King after a statue found above it.</p>
<p>You will also be visiting a unique jungle temple which is captivated by the large trees and vines that have grown over it, Ta Prohm. Ta Prohm is renowned as the most romantic experience of Angkor and even Historians have noted its mystical charm. Its photogenic and atmospheric combination of trees growing out of the ruins forms unique and exotic backdrop. It served as a backdrop for Hollywood blockbuster, “Tomb Raider”.</p>
<p>This afternoon, explore the Tonle Sap Lake in a private boat. Tonle Sap Lake, also known as the ‘Great Lake’ or ‘sea of fresh water', lies south of Angkor links the Mekong River to the southern end of the Great Lake. An unusual phenomenon of this river is that its water flow changes direction to run in reverse; the source of this phenomenon is in the Himalayan Mountains of Central Asia. When the snow melts, the water flows southward along the course of the Mekong River and its tributaries, but the silted channels of the Mekong River system are inadequate to accommodate the amount of water received because of which the Mekong River flows back. The impact of this overflow causes the Tonle Sap River to reverse its course each year between July and October and feed into the Great Lake.</p>
<p>On your private boat cruise pass floating houses, fish farms and view life on the water that dots the landscape. This is the best experience to explore rural Cambodia and gain a better understanding of the unique ecosystem rich with flora, fauna, fish and other wildlife.</p>
<p>Enjoy a romantic private couple massage by a team of skilled masseuses providing a range of traditional Cambodian treatments in the evening. You may choose to enjoy the spa in treatment rooms, privacy of your suite, by the poolside or on the roof terrace.</p>

Stop at the cleansing station where you may dip into a communal water tank to cleanse your hands and mouth before offering a prayer. You can write wishes on little pieces of paper and tie them onto the prayer wall, or do as the locals do - toss some yen into the offering box (it's near the enormous taiko drum), bow your head twice, clap twice, and bow once more.</p>
