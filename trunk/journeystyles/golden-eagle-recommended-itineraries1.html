<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 21 Days</p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong> Moscow, Volgograd, Kara Kum, Khiva, Olgograd, Kara Kum, Khiva, Ashgabat, Merv, Bukhara, Samarkand, Tashkent, Almaty, Urumchi, Turpan, Dunhuang, Jiayuguan, Xian, Beijing</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>

<h5>Moscow, Russia</h5>
<p>Arrive at Moscow airport, where you are met and transferred to the luxurious five-star Marriott Royal Aurora hotel (or similar) located in the heart of this vibrant city for a two-night stay. We enjoy a welcome dinner at our hotel, whilst you meet your fellow travellers and, together, look forward to the 21 day voyage that lies ahead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Moscow with Freedom of Choice Touring</h5>
<p>Our city tour of Moscow principally takes us to Red Square, an iconic symbol of Russia's former military and political might. Here we see an eclectic mix of fascinating architecture, such as the ornate St Basil's Cathedral with its magnificent onion-domed spires, the grandeur of The Kremlin and the sombre and evocative site of Lenin's  tomb.  With  our  Freedom  of  Choice  touring  options  you  may  instead  wish  to  visit,  for  example,  the Tretyakov Art Gallery (National Museum of Fine Art).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5> Onboard</h5>
<p>In the morning of Day 3, we board the Golden Eagle Trans-Siberian Express. After settling into our modern, stylish cabins, we enjoy dinner in one of the beautifully designed restaurant cars as our rail journey to Beijing begins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>Volgograd</h5>
<p>Standing on the banks of the Volga, Stalingrad, as the city was known in Soviet times, was the dramatic scene of one of the most important Second World War battles. The Russians heroically turned back the Nazi advance here to alter the course of the war. We visit the poignantly sobering Mamayev Kurgan war memorial, followed by the informative diorama and absorbing museum visit. In the evening we enjoy a beautifully prepared dinner on board our private train.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5> Kara Kum, Kazakhstan</h5>
<p>Today, we enjoy a relaxing day onboard as we travel across the vast expanses of the Kara Kum desert. As well as experiencing the unique landscape, we can take the opportunity to chat to fellow passengers and maybe take our first Russian language lesson.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>Khiva, Uzbekistan</h5>
<p>Crossing into Uzbekistan, our train travels towards Urgench, where we transfer to the ancient city of Khiva, founded 2,500 years ago. As one of the Silk Road's most important trading posts and now a World Heritage Site, it lies at the crossroads of the routes between Mongolia, Russia, China and Persia. A truly magnificent sight to behold, it rises out of the desert to reveal a wealth of impressive architecture. Stepping back in time, we discover its impressive mosques, bazaars and minarets within Khiva's ancient walls.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>Ashgabat, Turkmenistan</h5>
<p>In dramatic contrast to Khiva, we arrive in Ashgabat, capital of Turkmenistan - the 'Las Vegas of the Kara Kum'. Situated between the Kara Kum Desert and the Kopet Dag mountain range, its fountains, golden domes and towering modern buildings appear strangely incongruous in this desert setting.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 8</h4>
<h5>Merv</h5>
<p>Early morning sees us arrive in Mary, where we transfer to the ancient and mainly unrestored city of Merv. Once an important stopping point on the Silk Road, it claims to have briefly been the largest city in the world during the twelfth century. 1794 saw the demise of Merv, after the Emir of Bukhara destroyed the dam which the population depended on for its water. After our fascinating exploration we return to our train for dinner.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 9</h4>
<h5>Bukhara, Uzbekistan</h5>
<p>Bukhara is quite simply outstanding. Like Khiva, UNESCO sponsored the renovation of much of the city for its 2,500th anniversary in 1999. The highlight of this wonderful tour is a visit to The Ark, a fortified residence of the Emirs of Bukhara - the despotic and ruthless leaders who ruled until Soviet times. We then travel out of the city to experience the Emir's enchantingly named, Palace of the Moon and Stars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 10</h4>
<h5>Samarkand</h5>
<p>Founded in the 6th Century BC, Samarkland's stunning architecture hints at its former status as one of the most important cities in Asia. Today we will visit some of its most significant sites including Registan Square, the refined elegance of the beautifully proportioned Bibi Khanum Mosque and the Ulag Beg observatory, one of the earliest Islamic astronomical observatories built in 1428. After dinner we will visit the illuminated and awe-inspiring Registan Square before returning to our train for a late evening departure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 11</h4>
<h5>Tashkent</h5>
<p>Today we arrive in the capital city of Uzbekistan and spend the morning touring this modern Soviet-style city which was rebuilt following the devastating earthquake of 1966. We re-board the train for lunch as we head towards Kazakhstan and Almaty. This afternoon gives us the opportunity to relax with friends or listen to one of the informative lectures designed to give us a greater insight into this fascinating region.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 12</h4>
<h5>Almaty, Kazakhstan</h5>
<p>Just before lunch we arrive in Almaty - the largest city in Kazakhstan. This beautifully verdant city derives its name from 'Alma' meaning 'apple'. Just a short distance from the city, apple orchards thrive in abundance. We take a tour of the city including a visit to the wooden Zenkhov Cathedral located in Panfilov Park. Tonight is our final evening onboard the Golden Eagle and will be marked by a farewell banquet.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 13</h4>
<h5>Crossing into China</h5>
<p>As we arrive at the Kazakh border of Druzhba, we bid the Golden Eagle a final farewell. The border crossing takes 5 hours but our patience is rewarded as the Shangri-La Express private train awaits us in Alanshankou, the Chinese border station. We are now at liberty to settle into our comfortable cabins as we head further into the intriguing landscape of China. A welcome dinner is served in the restaurant cars, giving us our first taste of authentic Chinese cuisine.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 14</h4>
<h5>Urumchi & Turpan, China</h5>
<p>Urumchi is located in a verdant oasis between the lofty ice capped Bogda Peak, the vast Salt Lake, the pine covered Southern Hill and the alternating fields and sand dunes of the Zunggar Basin. Urumchi boasts an entry in the Guinness Book of Records for being the city furthest from any sea in the world - a staggering 1,400 miles (2,500km) from the nearest coastline. This morning we visit the renowned mummy exhibition at the Provincial Museum. After lunch we travel to Turpan, where the Flaming Mountains create a magnificent backdrop. We then take a fascinating tour to the ancient underground irrigation system that has successfully fed the rich orchards and vineyards for centuries. Our final destination is the elegantly decaying sand city of Jiaohe that was founded in 108 BC.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 15</h4>
<h5>Dunhuang</h5>
<p>Before lunch we arrive in the small oasis-city of Dunhuang, where we will visit the fascinating Magao Thousand Buddha Cave Complex. This impressive site contains almost 500 grottoes, carved between 700 and 1,700 years ago. Inside we will see an amazing collection of beautiful sculptures and murals depicting the evolution of Buddhist religious art over a 1,000 year period. In the afternoon we explore the vast natural beauty of the Gobi Desert by camel. Here we discover Crescent Lake. Hidden amongst towering sand dunes, it has sustained life in this region for millennia. Tonight we experience dinner and a local folk performance in this magical setting.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 16</h4>
<h5>Jiayuguan</h5>
<p>This morning our private train arrives in Jiayuguan. Famous for being the first pass at the most westerly point of the Great Wall of China, it was given the rather poetic name: 'The first and greatest pass under Heaven'. Our tour takes us to the perfectly restored fortress at the end of the Great Wall which dates back to 1372. Considered one of the greatest sites in northwest China, we spend time here and visit its excellent museum. This afternoon we spend time in the Bar Car either attending a lecture on the Great Wall or simply relax as the landscape unfolds before us.

</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 17</h4>
<h5>Xian with Freedom of Choice Touring</h5>
<p>Our fascinating journey of discovery takes us to Xian. Our morning arrival gives us several hours to explore the world famous Terracotta Warriors, discovered by peasants only 30 years ago. The 6,000 terracotta figures and their horses are one of the greatest archaeological finds of the 20th Century. Alternatively, we will offer a visit to the Han Yangling Museum. This tomb dating back 2,000 years with its adjoining museum is one of China's finest undiscovered secrets. This evening we enjoy the Tang Dynasty Dinner, Music and Dance Show, a wonderful performance of ancient entertainment.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 18</h4>
<h5>Beijing</h5>
<p>Spending our last day onboard the Shangri-La Express we wind our way northwards towards the capital of China, Beijing. Having travelled a mammoth 7,000 miles (11,250km) from Moscow, we bid farewell to our train crew and transfer to the five-star Regent Hotel (or similar) for a three-night stay.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 19</h4>
<h5>Beijing with Freedom of Choice Touring</h5>
<p>Today we visit Tiananmen Square and then explore the magnificently restored Forbidden City. Our cultural exploration continues at the Temple of Heaven, the grandest of the four great temples situated in Beijing. Here we experience enchanting displays of traditional dancing, singing and the delicately precise ancient art of calligraphy. Alternatively, with our Freedom of Choice programme take a tour looking at Beijing's modern architecture with visits to the Olympic Village including the Bird's Nest Stadium, the National Centre for Performing Arts, colloquially known as The Egg, the CCTV Tower and the National Museum.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 20</h4>
<h5>Beijing - The Great Wall</h5>
<p>We devote our final full day in Beijing to the most awe-inspiring site in the whole of China - The Great Wall. This amazing edifice is one of the few man-made structures visible from outer space and perhaps the most evocative symbol of Chinese skill and precision. At Badaling we have the privilege of walking along a portion of the wall - the perfect opportunity to take some memorable photographs with your fellow guests. Our farewell banquet is hosted in an authentic Peking Duck restaurant, where we say goodbye to our fellow travelling companions.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 21</h4>
<h5>Beijing</h5>
<p>Following breakfast, you will be transferred to Beijing airport for international departures.

<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 13 Days</p>
<p>Moscow - Kazan- Yekaterinburg - Novosibirsk - Irkutsk - Lake Baikal - Ulan ude - Ulaan Baatar (for Naadam Festival)</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>Moscow</h5>
<p>Arrive at Moscow airport, where you are met and transferred to the luxurious five-star Marriott Royal Aurora hotel (or similar) located in the heart of this vibrant city for a one-night stay. We enjoy a welcome reception dinner at our hotel, whilst you meet your fellow travellers and anticipate the exciting voyage that lies ahead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Moscow with Freedom of Choice Touring</h5>
<p>Our morning city tour of Moscow principally takes us to Red Square, an iconic symbol of Russia's former military and political might. Here we see an eclectic mix of fascinating architecture, such as the ornate St Basil's Cathedral with its magnificent onion-domed spires, the grandeur of The Kremlin and the sombre and evocative site of Lenin's tomb. With our Freedom of Choice touring options you may instead wish to visit, for example, the Tretyakov Gallery (National Museum of Fine Art). Early afternoon sees us boarding the luxurious Golden Eagle Trans-Siberian Express. After settling into our modern, stylish cabins, we enjoy dinner in one of the beautifully designed restaurant cars as our rail adventure eastwards to Ulaan Baatar begins.

</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>Kazan</h5>
<p>We arrive at the picturesque and historic city of Kazan by mid-morning. Situated on the River Volga, Kazan is the capital of Tatarstan. Here we have the opportunity to see for ourselves its rich tapestry of history and culture. One of the highlights of this city tour is our exploration of the Kremlin Fortress, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Within the walls of this ancient citadel we will explore its stunning mosque and onion-domed cathedral. After enjoying a relaxing dinner on the Golden Eagle, you may wish to retire to our welcoming bar car where you can enjoy drinks with new friends whilst listening to our resident pianist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>Yekaterinburg</h5>
<p>We cross the Europe/Asia divide before arriving in the historic city of Yekaterinburg. Founded in 1723 by Peter the Great, the third largest Russian city is also the capital of the Urals. The cultural and architectural influences of European and Asian civilisations come together in this fascinating and cosmopolitan landscape. Our city tour takes us to the poignant site where the Romanov, Nicholas II of Russia was executed with his family by the Bolsheviks in 1918. Now a church dedicated to their memory, this site provides us with a powerful insight into the turmoil of the Russian Revolution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>Novosibirsk</h5>
<p>A modern 'Soviet' city, we experience the life and character of Novosibirsk's rich culture where the arts, science and literature predominate. Our city tour takes us to the Opera House. An architectural marvel, it houses two permanent ballet and opera companies and is the largest opera house in the world. In front of the Opera House, we visit an imposing statue of Lenin - a marvellous opportunity to have your photograph taken with this iconic political leader.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>Onboard</h5>
<p>A day to unwind and reflect on the many sights and sounds we have experienced on our journey so far. Chat to your fellow passengers, perhaps learn a few words of Russian or simply enjoy the ever changing landscape outside your window as it unfolds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>Irkutsk</h5>
<p>We arrive in Irkutsk, the 'Paris of Siberia', and our visit today takes in the most significant sites and museums in this fascinating city, including an exploration of the classic wooden architecture that has given many of this region's buildings such a distinctive and unique appearance. Next, we visit the Decembrist House museum which is dedicated to the memory of the exiled aristocrats who were forced to flee to this remote outpost after the failed revolution of 1825. Here we enjoy a private concert before returning to our waiting train for dinner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 8</h4>
<h5>Lake Baikal</h5>
<p>Few natural sights can surpass the beauty and grandeur of Lake Baikal. For five hours we wind our way through tunnels along cliff hugging tracks above the lake with a vista of snow capped peaks along the far shore forming a picture-perfect backdrop. Lake Baikal is the deepest lake in the world and holds 20% of the world's freshwater. Also known as the 'Pearl of Siberia' it is home to a unique breed of freshwater seal and over fifty species of fish including omul which we will be serving in the dining car for some of our meals. Weather permitting, we stop at one of Baikal's picturesque and secluded bays to enjoy a delicious BBQ including freshly smoked fish prepared by our own chefs. For the brave hearted, there is even time for a refreshing swim in the crystal clear waters. In the afternoon, we visit Listvyanka, a small Baikal settlement nestling at the base of the surrounding hills.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 9</h4>
<h5>Ulan Ude</h5>
<p>This morning we arrive in Ulan Ude, capital of the Buryat Republic. The ethnic and cultural diversity of this area offers a unique insight into its heritage. As we tour the area you will notice the different faces and dress styles of these welcoming people. During our exploration of the Old Believers Village we have the opportunity to learn about the culture and history of these religious people as we are treated to a traditional meal and enjoy a concert featuring local dancers and musicians.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 10</h4>
<h5>Ulaan Baatar</h5>
<p>Our Trans-Mongolian adventure takes us to Ulaan Baatar, the capital of Mongolia and our final destination where we spend the next three nights. Passing the central monument to Genghis Khan, undoubtedly the most feared and revered Mongol, we visit Gandon Monastery and the National History Museum where we explore the country's intriguing history. Lunch is taken Mongol style in Terelj National Park, in a traditional Ger (Yurt) restaurant where we experience an authentic meal, enjoying excellent local dishes and entertainment providing a unique opportunity to encounter this time-honoured nomadic way of life. There will be the option to experience horse riding or simply enjoy free time enjoying the scenery of this beautiful area.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 11</h4>
<h5>Ulaan Baatar</h5>
<p>Today we spend a full day at the Naadam Festival. We get to observe the elaborate opening ceremony which consists of local dancers, athletes, horse riders and musicians, before watching the national horse race.

<p>This is the day for all main competitions. In the morning we'll attend archery, wrestling and ankle bone shooting. After a Mongolian barbecue lunch we will visit the Museum of Religion. This evening we enjoy our farewell dinner in Ulaan Baatar with folk songs and dance Mongolian-style.

<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 15 days</p>
<p>Moscow - Kazan - Yekaterinburg - Novoisbirsk- Irkutsk- Lake Baikal- Ulan Ude - Ulaan Baatar (Mongolia)- Vladivostok </p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>Moscow</h5>
<p>Arrive at Moscow airport, where you are met and transferred to the luxurious five-star Marriott Royal Aurora hotel (or similar) located in the heart of this vibrant city for a one-night stay. We enjoy a welcome reception dinner at our hotel, whilst you meet your fellow travellers and anticipate the epic 15 day voyage that lies ahead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Moscow with Freedom of Choice Touring</h5>
<p>Our morning city tour of Moscow principally takes us to Red Square, an iconic symbol of Russia's former military and political might. Here we see an eclectic mix of fascinating architecture, such as the ornate St Basil's Cathedral with its magnificent onion-domed spires, the grandeur of The Kremlin and the sombre and evocative site of Lenin's tomb. With our Freedom of Choice touring options you may instead wish to visit, for example, the Tretyakov Gallery (National Museum of Fine Art). Early afternoon sees us boarding the luxurious Golden Eagle Trans-Siberian Express. After settling into our modern, stylish cabins, we enjoy dinner in one of the beautifully designed restaurant cars as our rail adventure eastwards to Vladivostok begins.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>Kazan</h5>
<p>We arrive at the picturesque and historic city of Kazan by mid-morning. Situated on the River Volga, Kazan is the capital of Tatarstan. Here we have the opportunity to see for ourselves its rich tapestry of history and culture. One of the highlights of this city tour is our exploration of the Kremlin Fortress, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Within the walls of this ancient citadel we will explore its stunning mosque and onion-domed cathedral. After enjoying a relaxing dinner on the Golden Eagle, you may wish to retire to our welcoming bar car where you can enjoy drinks with new friends whilst listening to our resident pianist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>Yekaterinburg</h5>
<p>We cross the Europe/Asia divide before arriving in the historic city of Yekaterinburg. Founded in 1723 by Peter the Great, the third largest Russian city is also the capital of the Urals. The cultural and architectural influences of European and Asian civilisations come together in this fascinating and cosmopolitan landscape. Our city tour takes us to the poignant site where the Romanov, Nicholas II of Russia was executed with his family by the Bolsheviks in 1918. Now a church dedicated to their memory, this site provides us with a powerful insight into the turmoil of the Russian Revolution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>Novosibirsk</h5>
<p>A modern 'Soviet' city, we experience the life and character of Novosibirsk's rich culture where the arts, science and literature predominate. Our city tour takes us to the Opera House. An architectural marvel, it houses two permanent ballet and opera companies and is the largest opera house in the world. In front of the Opera House, we visit an imposing statue of Lenin - a marvellous opportunity to have your photograph taken with this iconic political leader.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>Onboard</h5>

<h5>Irkutsk</h5>
<p>We arrive in Irkutsk, the 'Paris of Siberia', and our visit today takes in the most significant sites and museums in this fascinating city, including an exploration of the classic wooden architecture that has given many of this region's buildings such a distinctive and unique appearance. Next, we visit the Decembrist House museum which is dedicated to the memory of the exiled aristocrats who were forced to flee to this remote outpost after the failed revolution of 1825. Here we enjoy a private concert before returning to our waiting train for dinner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 8</h4>
<h5>Lake Baikal</h5>
<p>Few natural sights can surpass the beauty and grandeur of Lake Baikal. For five hours we wind our way through tunnels along cliff hugging tracks above the lake with a vista of snow capped peaks along the far shore forming a picture-perfect backdrop. Lake Baikal is the deepest lake in the world and holds 20% of the world's freshwater. Also known as the 'Pearl of Siberia' it is home to a unique breed of freshwater seal and over fifty species of fish including omul which we will be serving in the dining car for some of our meals. Weather permitting, we stop at one of Baikal's picturesque and secluded bays to enjoy a delicious BBQ including freshly smoked fish prepared by our own chefs. For the brave hearted, there is even time for a refreshing swim in the crystal clear waters. In the afternoon, we visit Listvyanka, a small Baikal settlement nestling at the base of the surrounding hills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 9</h4>
<h5>Ulan Ude</h5>
<p>This morning we arrive in Ulan Ude, capital of the Buryat Republic. The ethnic and cultural diversity of this area offers a unique insight into its heritage. As we tour the area you will notice the different faces and dress styles of these welcoming people.

</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 10</h4>
<h5>Ulaan Baatar, Mongolia</h5>
<p>Our Trans-Siberian adventure takes us onto Ulaan Baatar, the capital of Mongolia. Passing the central monument to Genghis Khan, undoubtedly the most feared and revered Mongol, we visit the National Museum where we explore the country's intriguing history. Lunch is taken Mongol style in a traditional Ger (Yurt) where we experience an authentic meal, enjoying excellent local dishes and entertainment providing a unique opportunity to encounter this time-honoured nomadic way of life. You are free to spend your afternoon shopping for traditional Mongolian gifts or there is an option to drive through Gorkhi-Terelj National Park. We board the train in time for dinner as we head back into Russia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 11</h4>
<h5>Onboard</h5>
<p>Enjoy a more leisurely pace today as we travel through the beautiful landscape of the Russian Far East. You may like to attend one of the interesting lectures or Russian language lessons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 12</h4>
<h5>Onboard</h5>
<p>It is the perfect opportunity to practice your Russian or simply relax as our journey today follows the Shilka and Amur rivers, close to the Chinese border. Enjoy Russia at its most dramatic and remote, as the Golden Eagle eats up the miles on our way to Vladivostok.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 13</h4>
<h5>Onboard</h5>
<p>Passing directly north of Seoul, Darwin and Osaka, we spend our last full day on board the Golden Eagle today as the most easterly point of our mammoth journey is reached passing through Khabarovsk, where we cross the River Amur. Tonight, we enjoy our final dinner onboard our private train that has been our home for the last twelve days as we approach our final destination on this unforgettable journey.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 14</h4>
<h5>Vladivostok</h5>
<p>After travelling through 8 time zones and covering an amazing 6,600 miles (10,600km) along this epic route to the end of the Trans-Siberian line, the Golden Eagle pulls into Vladivostok, a military port located on the western shores of the Sea of Japan. Vladivostok (literally translated as 'Ruler of the East') offers visitors an exciting opportunity to explore its principal military attractions including a tour of a restored submarine before we transfer to the centrally located four-star Hotel Hyundai (or similar). The final evening is spent saying our goodbyes to our fellow travelling companions and friends at the Farewell Dinner.
</p>
</li>

Now a church dedicated to their memory, this site provides us with a powerful insight into the turmoil of the Russian Revolution. We cross the Europe/Asia divide after we leave Yekaterinburg.

<h4>Day 13</h4>
<h5>Kazan</h5>
<p>We spend our last full day on board the Golden Eagle today. We arrive at the picturesque and historic city of Kazan by mid-morning. Situated on the River Volga, Kazan is the capital of Tatarstan. Here we have the opportunity to see for ourselves its rich tapestry of history and culture. One of the highlights of this city tour is our exploration of the Kremlin Fortress, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Within the walls of this ancient citadel we will explore its stunning mosque and magnificent onion-domed cathedral.

<h4>Day 14</h4>
<h5>Moscow with Freedom of Choice Touring</h5>
<p>After travelling over an amazing 6,600 miles (10,600km) along this epic route to the end of the Trans-Siberian line, we arrive in Moscow. Our city tour of Moscow principally takes us to Red Square, an iconic symbol of Russia's former military and political might. Here we see an eclectic mix of fascinating architecture, such as the ornate St Basil's Cathedral with its magnificent onion-domed spires, the grandeur of The Kremlin and the sombre and evocative site of Lenin's tomb. With our Freedom of Choice touring options you may wish instead to visit, for example, the Tretyakov Gallery (National Museum of Fine Art). At the conclusion of our city tour, we transfer to the luxurious five-star Marriott Royal Aurora hotel (or similar) located in the heart of this vibrant city. Our final evening is spent saying our goodbyes to our fellow travelling companions and friends at the Farewell Dinner.</p>

Enjoy a full day exploring the Serengeti by 4WD vehicle with thrilling morning and afternoon game drives. Whether this is your first time on safari or a return trip the Serengeti will not disappoint.<br /><br />The Serengeti National Park is arguably the most famous national park in the world. The Serengeti perhaps defines the safari experience as surely as the wildlife that inhabits it. Established in 1951, and covering an area of almost 15,000 sq km, an area comparable to the state of Connecticut or Northern Ireland, the Serengeti hosts a fantastically diverse ecosystem. The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, where 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other plains game that follow close behind, make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";

The Selous supports around one million game animals, is bigger than Switzerland and is a World Heritage site.

Transfer from Arusha to Ngorongoro Crater Lodge located on the rim with spectacular views across the crater. The Ngorongoro Crater is the largest unbroken caldera in the world and the first sight of it is breathtaking.<br /><br />Ngorongoro Crater Lodge is situated on the edge of the ancient crater rim above the cool, swirling mists. The lodge is a return to the noble elegance of the travelling colonials. Inspired in design by the Maasai Manyatta, three separate camps of 6 to 12 suites each remember a bygone era when characters such as Lord Delamere adorned the stilted, handcrafted structures with graceful antiques, grand chandeliers and treasures collected from travels through Africa.<br /><br /></p>";

Rhinos can often be seen with calves at heel. Eland and waterbuck appear not to notice the human visitors, enabling photographers to shoot at ease. On the lake in the middle of the crater you may see thousands of flamingos fluttering and shimmering like a pink heat haze. Zebra and wildebeest account for almost half the animals.
