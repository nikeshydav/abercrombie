<h5>Anchorage, Alaska/Kenai Peninsula</h5>

<p><strong>Overnight: </strong> Hotel Alyeska</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Kenai Peninsula</h5>
<p>Visit the Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center en route to the Kenai River. This nonprofit organization rehabilitates injured or orphaned animals and returns them to the wild. During your visit, you may see local wildlife, including bears, moose, bison, elk and a variety of birds. This afternoon, take a float trip through Kenai National Wildlife Refuge. Beavers and otters make their homes along the water, and bears and moose are commonly spied on shore. Tonight, sit down to a barbecue dinner, followed by a riverside campfire and s'mores roast.</p>
<p> <strong>Overnight: </strong> Hotel Alyeska <br /> 
<strong>Meal plan: </strong> B, L, D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>Kenai Peninsula</h5>
<p>Cruise the Kenai Fjords National Park, and witness the crash of calving glaciers. The park occupies more than half a million acres and is covered by an ice pack extending more than 700 square miles. You may see humpback whales, orcas, puffins and sea lions at close range; look to the skies for a glimpse of bald eagles overhead. Ride the double-decker Alaska Railroad GoldStar Dome train, which is adorned with original Alaskan art and features an upper-level, open-air platform and a glass-covered observation deck offering sensational views of the countryside.</p>

<p>Travel by float plane over Cook Inlet to Redoubt Bay Bear Sanctuary, where a large population of bears prowl the river in search of a meal. Upon arrival, you are briefed on proper "bear etiquette" before taking to the creeks on pontoon boats. Watch safely from your pontoon boat as they snatch salmon from the water - sometimes even in mid-leap.

Although you may not rake in as many fish as the bears you saw yesterday did, with the supplied fishing equipment - tackle, boots and rain gear - you should have a very rewarding morning nonetheless. This afternoon, go on a geocaching adventure, a high-tech treasure hunt using handheld GPS devices, on the grounds of your lodge.

<p> <strong>Overnight: </strong> Talkeetna Alaskan Lodge <br /> 
<strong>Meal plan: </strong> B, L</p>

Step out to the banks of the Talkeetna River to look for wildlife and enjoy spectacular views of Mount McKinley and the Alaska Range. You may also visit Denali National Park's Talkeetna Ranger Station, the last stop for climbing expeditions headed up Mount McKinley.</p>
<p> <strong>Overnight: </strong> Talkeetna Alaskan Lodge <br /> 
<strong>Meal plan: </strong> B, L</p>

<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>Talkeetna/Anchorage</h5>
<p>Take a thrilling flight over the peaks and glaciers of Denali National Park. Fly over Don Sheldon Amphitheater (a natural formation named for a renowned Alaskan pilot), the two-mile-deep Great Gorge and the Kahiltna Glacier, a popular route for climbers attempting the summit of Mount McKinley. Your pilot, linked to you by two-way headset throughout the flight, explains the highlights you see. Land on a glacier's surface, and disembark to experience the majesty of Alaska's beauty, with snow-veiled peaks surrounding a vast snowfield stretching in every direction. This afternoon, meet and have lunch with four-time Iditarod champion Martin Buser, and meet his Alaskan husky team.<p>
<p>Continue to Anchorage and enjoy a brief city tour, including the downtown district, and a demonstration of the traditional Alaska Ulus. Celebrate your Alaskan adventure at a farewell dinner tonight.</p>

Enjoy the solitude whilst observing elephants, lions, buffalo, hippos and crocodiles. Game drives are conducted by 4WD vehicles or from your river boat, the more adventurous of you may like to stretch your legs with a walking safari.<br /><br />The Selous Game Reserve is the largest game reserve in the world and has some of the finest virgin bush left in Africa, where the last of the really big-tusked elephants and large-maned lions roam. The Selous supports around one million game animals, is bigger than Switzerland and is a World Heritage site. From March to May floods sweep the valley, forcing the game on to the 'islands' of higher ground, where elephant, buffalo, lion, leopard, crocodile, puku, buck, eland, sable and others concentrate.<br /></p>";

Covering 21,000 square miles of completely undeveloped land, the Selous is one of the last great tracts of true wilderness left in Africa.<br /></p>";

Upon arrival at Arusha airport you will be met by your private driver/guide who will escort you for the duration of your safari in Tanzania. Transfer from Arusha to Ngorongoro Crater Lodge located on the rim with spectacular views across the crater. The Ngorongoro Crater is the largest unbroken caldera in the world and the first sight of it is breathtaking.<br /><br />Ngorongoro Crater Lodge is situated on the edge of the ancient crater rim above the cool, swirling mists. The lodge is a return to the noble elegance of the travelling colonials. Inspired in design by the Maasai Manyatta, three separate camps of 6 to 12 suites each remember a bygone era when characters such as Lord Delamere adorned the stilted, handcrafted structures with graceful antiques, grand chandeliers and treasures collected from travels through Africa.<br /><br /></p>";

Spot some of the rarer species in Africa like the black rhino against the spectacular backdrop of the crater's forest covered walls. Enjoy a picnic lunch amongst the hippos and birds before visiting a Maasai village this afternoon.<br /><br />The floor of the crater is only 100 sq miles but is home to around 30,000 animals with a high concentration of predators and some of the finest black-maned lions in Africa. Rhinos can often be seen with calves at heel. Eland and waterbuck appear not to notice the human visitors, enabling photographers to shoot at ease. On the lake in the middle of the crater you may see thousands of flamingos fluttering and shimmering like a pink heat haze. Zebra and wildebeest account for almost half the animals. Gazelle, buffalo, eland, hartebeest and wart hog can also be seen.<br /></p>";

The camp offers spectacular views across Tortillis woodland situated on the edge of the short grass plains. The camp is comprised of nine double tents scattered around the kopje with the mess tent and common area as the central feature. Privacy between tents is guaranteed as they are at a substantial distance from each other and are generally concealed by a tree or kopje.<br /></p>";
