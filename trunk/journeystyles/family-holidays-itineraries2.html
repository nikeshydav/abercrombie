</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>

<h5>Arrive San Jose, Costa Rica</h5>
<p>Arrive in San Jose, and settle in to your colonial hacienda-style hotel, located on a flourishing, 30-acre coffee plantation.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Marriott Hotel</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>San Jose/Tortuguero</h5>
<p>This morning, embark on a heart-thumping zipline adventure between six panoramic platforms. Watch for local wildlife as you zoom through tree canopies and across the magnificent Molinete River within the verdant natural surroundings of the 1,200-acre Rain Forest Aerial Tram Park. Later this afternoon, board a private boat from the Ca�o Blanco dock, continuing to Tortuguero and your lodge, nestled amid a tangle of tropical foliage.
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Tortuga Lodge<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B L D</p>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5> Tortuguero </h5>
<p>Today, you start your adventure exploring this tropical paradise. You may take a guided bird walk before voyaging down the slow- moving tropical rivers that define Tortuguero National Park, one of the last large, intact tropical rainforests in Central America. Search for wildlife hidden within the thick flora, perhaps spider, howler and
white-faced monkeys; three-toed sloths; river otters; caimans; iguanas; river turtles; basilisk lizards; and poison dart frogs. This region is also perfect for birders, as it showcases a multitude of bird species. Later, explore the village of San Francisco. If time permits, you may also visit a neighborhood school (when in session), or join local children in a game of soccer.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Tortuga Lodge<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B L D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>Tortuguero</h5>
<p>This morning, head north by motorized boat to Ca�o Palma (Palm Canal) for an exciting kayak adventure, travelling to places motorized boats cannot reach. Paddle through the wildlife-rich canal, visiting one of the most magical places in the flooded forest. The Tortuguero area is situated on an ancient floodplain and consists of lowland tropical wet forest; it is the richest biological ecosystem in all of Costa Rica. Later this afternoon, take some time to relax and unwind, gathering the children for a garden walk. Those who prefer may also have fun in the sun at the pool.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Tortuga Lodge<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B L D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5> Tortuguero/Fortuna (Arenal)</h5>
<p>Depart on a short private charter flight to Arenal. Upon arrival, a private van and driver transfers you to your hotel at the base of the Arenal Volcano. Marvel at the famed volcano's near-perfect cone, which soars 5,357 feet above sea level and has a crater over 450 feet deep. Afterward, visit Finca Burio (Burio Farm), which is owned by Don Juan. Take a comprehensive tour through the plantations with the farmer himself, while learning about the benefits and uses of fruit you may never have seen. You may also watch for many resident birds, and learn to process sugar cane at a trapiche (sugar mill). Next, sit down for an organic lunch, prepared just for you by Don Juan's wife, Do�a Yamileth.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Arenal Nayara Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B L</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>Fortuna</h5>
<p>After breakfast, set out for the picturesque Arenal hanging bridges with your private guide. The site was designed to blend with the natural environment, while leaving the forest habitat virtually intact. As you walk, absorb the diversity of flora and wildlife that call the rainforest home; meanwhile, see imposing views of the volcano (weather permitting) from your perch. Later this afternoon, visit the Hidalgo family's hot springs, a less-populated alternative to the overcrowded hot springs found elsewhere in the Arenal area. Tucked nearly a mile off the main road connecting Lake Arenal Dam and La Fortuna, the springs consist of five free-flowing pools situated amid a natural river gorge. The water temperature in the pools can get as high as 109 degrees Fahrenheit. Cool off after your dip with blended smoothies and cocktails made with delicious local ingredients at the pool area bar. Afterward, enjoy an authentic homestyle meal during your farewell dinner at the on-site restaurant, which is modeled after the first house that Don Manuel and Do�a Hortemida Hidalgo built when they settled on the farm in 1940.
</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Arenal Nayara Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>Depart San Jose</h5>
<p>This morning, return to San Jose. Later this afternoon, board your homebound flight, or continue to your next Latin American destination.
</p>

Rhinos can be seen with calves at heel. Eland and waterbuck appear not to notice the human visitors, enabling photographers to shoot at ease.

<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 8 days</p>
<p>During this interactive Family journey, play the role of a Roman soldier at a gladiator school in Rome, toss your own pizza, learn how gelato is made and explore historic cities at your own pace.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong> &bull; Take a gondola ride - the perfect way to explore Venice <br />

&bull; Make your own pizza at a pizzeria in Rome </p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>Arrive Venice, Italy</h5>
<p>Arrive in Venice and take a private launch to your hotel. Venice is like no other city because it is made up of hundreds of islands, some connected by bridges. The canals are its streets, and you can get around either by water taxi or on foot. Even the fire engines and police vehicles are boats that travel through the canals. This evening, meet other travelling families during a welcome dinner at the hotel.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Hotel Danieli <br />
 <strong>Meal Plan:</strong> D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Venice</h5>
<p>Take a walk with your guide through St. Mark's Square, which is filled with caf�s, people and pigeons. Gaze at the Basilica, Bell Tower and the pink-and-white marble Doge's Palace - the former seat of governmental departments and residence of the Doge, ruler of the Venetian Republic. Beneath the Doge's Palace lies a reminder of its gruesome past: a maze of cells linked by corridors and staircases, where countless prisoners met an untimely end. Stay close to your guide as you explore - you wouldn't want to be locked in. Throughout your time in the city, look for the winged lion that represents St. Mark - its symbol is emblazoned on the Venetian flag. Spend the afternoon at leisure and take a gondola ride through the canals tonight.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Hotel Danieli <br />
 <strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B </p>

</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>Venice/Bologna/Florence</h5>

After lunch, there is time at leisure to explore Bologna, one of Italy's best-preserved medieval city centers. See the 14th-century Basilica San Petronio and the church complex of Santo Stefano. Arrive in Florence at the end of the afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Helvetia & Bristol<br />
 <strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B L D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>Florence</h5>
<p>Set on the Arno River below the foothills of the Apennines, Florence is a living legacy of the Renaissance. Walk through historic Florence, seeing palaces and the Duomo (Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore), and stop at the famous Uffizi Gallery, housing a magnificent art collection that includes works by Titian, Caravaggio, Raphael and Giotto. The museums hold famous works of art, but the historic streets and buildings, too, hold fascination and cultural significance. Next to the Uffizi is the Palazzo Vecchio, once the home of the Medici family. The tower's patrol path has been recently restored. Follow your guide along the path and learn about the guard's cunning plans to thwart invaders. Once you conquer the path, you are rewarded with views of the city.</p>
<p>See many of the city's age-old monuments, including one that A&K Philanthropy is helping to restore. No tour of Florence is complete without a visit to one of the city's best gelaterie to sample your favorite flavor. This evening is at leisure to relax or continue exploring on your own.</p>

<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>Florence/Pisa/Florence</h5>
<p>In Pisa, visit the Baptistery and Duomo in the beautiful Campo dei Miracoli (Square of Miracles). The famous Leaning Tower, started in the 12th century, is also located there. When workers completed the third floor, they noticed that the tower started to sink into the ground, and construction ceased for 90 years. If you are ready for the challenge, climb the 294 spiral steps to the top to look out over the city. After lunch at a local restaurant, return to Florence.</p>

<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 9 Days</p>
<p>On this action-packed Family adventure, young travellers engage in many activities, including archery with the local Maasai, casting animal tracks in plaster and making fire in time-honored fashion.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong> &bull; A Children's Activity Coordinator travels with the group throughout the journey, providing a range of age-appropriate activities<br/>
&bull; Visit Daphne Sheldrick's Orphanage, seeing young elephant lovingly interact with handlers before they are reintroduced to the wild<br/>
&bull; Opportunity to feed the tallest animal in the world at the Giraffe Center<br/>
&bull; Visit Kenya's only chimpanzee sanctuary in the Ol Pejeta Conservancy, which is also one of the largest rhino sanctuaries in East Africa<br/>
&bull; Acquaint yourself with the local Maasai or Samburu people, who share their knowledge of fire-starting, spear-throwing and animal tracking, as well as beadwork and leatherwork</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>Arrive Nairobi, Kenya</h5>
<p>Arrive by overnight flight in Nairobi, the starting point for your adventure through the wilds of Kenya. Prepare to meet elephants up close, watch hunters on the prowl and interact with an African tribe in their own village.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Nairobi Serena Hotel</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Nairobi</h5>
<p>Start your day at the Giraffe Center, home to the endangered, graceful Rothschild giraffe. Offer them food while perched upon a platform, watching as they gently snatch it from your hand with their long, blue tongues. Continue to Daphne Sheldrick's Orphanage to see small elephants cared for by attentive keepers until they are ready to return to the wild in Tsavo National Park. You may see elephant calves bathing in the mud hole and being bottle-fed by human surrogate mothers. Gather with the other families sharing your adventure at tonight's festive welcome dinner.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Nairobi Serena Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B D
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>Nairobi/Nanyuki</h5>
<p>Drive to the Sweetwaters Reserve within the Ol Pejeta Conservancy at the foot of Mount Kenya. Set out in search of animals by safari vehicle, or take an optional escorted walk or a night game drive. You can even view game from your tent, which overlooks a floodlit waterhole and salt-lick, much frequented by animals. In the evening, your private veranda provides a front-row seat to the wildlife moving in and out of the shadows as they come to drink at the waterhole. Sweetwaters is an excellent place to see two of Africa's most endangered species: black rhino and chimpanzee. Special reserves are set aside to keep them safe so that their species can continue for many more years.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Sweetwaters Tented Camp <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B L D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>Nanyuki/Samburu Game Reserve</h5>
<p>Travel to the bush of the Samburu Game Reserve. Your comfortable tented camp is perched along the banks of the Ewaso Nyiro River, which is a lifeline and the nerve center of this reserve; animals congregate along its banks to quench their thirst. The reserve is also the home of the Samburu people who live a pastoral life herding cattle, goats and sheep. They are nomadic and move their families and animals to new pastures every few weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Samburu Intrepids<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B L D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>Samburu Game Reserve</h5>
<p>After an early-morning game drive, return to camp for breakfast; then visit a local Samburu village to learn about their traditional ways of life. While your family is at Samburu, you may also take guided walks with a focus on game tracking (optional), catch butterflies, embark on treasure hunts, play football or volleyball, swim, or paint and draw - your tented safari camp offers fun options for every member of the family.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Samburu Intrepids <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B L D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>Samburu/Masai Mara Game Reserve</h5>
<p>Awaken to the sounds of the wilderness. After breakfast, board a flight across the Great Rift Valley to the Masai Mara, land of the red-robed Maasai tribe. Arrive at your tented camp beside a sweeping bend in the Talek River and take an afternoon game drive across the limitless plains. The reserve borders Tanzania, and the two countries share the vast Serengeti plains, with wildlife free to roam in search of food. The Mara is one of the few areas where you are likely to see the "Big Five:" buffalo, elephants, rhinos, lions and leopards.
</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Mara Intrepids<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B L D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 7-8</h4>
<h5>Masai Mara Game Reserve</h5>
<p>Spend two days in this magnificent savanna country, home to Kenya's most varied animal population. Listen for the roars of mighty lions; they can be heard from five miles away. Be on the lookout for elephants, giraffes and zebras. You might even see cheetahs dashing across the plains or rhinos lumbering along. With a little luck, you might notice leopards trying to stay out of sight, biding their time until nightfall. Young adventurers experience a mammal study on morning and afternoon game drives, identify animal tracks and cast them in plaster, and set out on nature walks with an eye toward herbal medicine. Meanwhile, discover abundant birdlife and learn to identify bird calls, bills, tracks, habitats and plumage patterns. Learn the art of beadwork and leatherwork, as well as basic bush survival skills, such as how to properly throw a spear or start a fire with sticks. At night, your family watches a display of traditional Maasai song and dance. Consider taking an optional hot air balloon safari, an amazing way to start the day - and an experience your family will never forget. End your stay in the Mara with a farewell dinner and say goodbye to your new friends.</p>
<p>Between game drives, you may even visit a primary school in the local village that is supported by A&K Philanthropy.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Mara Intrepids<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B L D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 9</h4>
<h5>Masai Mara/Nairobi/Depart</h5>
<p>Fly back to Nairobi. A dayroom is reserved for you to use until it is time to go to the airport for your homebound flight. You may wish to relax in your hotel near Nairobi's downtown area, enjoying its Maisha Health Club, or take care of some last-minute shopping.

The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, where 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other plains game that follow close behind, make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";

Inspired in design by the Maasai Manyatta, three separate camps of 6 to 12 suites each remember a bygone era when characters such as Lord Delamere adorned the stilted, handcrafted structures with graceful antiques, grand chandeliers and treasures collected from travels through Africa.<br /><br /></p>";

From your lodge on the crater rim descend to the crater floor by 4WD safari vehicle for a morning unlike any other you will experience in Africa. Spot some of the rarer species in Africa like the black rhino against the spectacular backdrop of the crater's forest covered walls. Enjoy a picnic lunch amongst the hippos and birds before visiting a Maasai village this afternoon.<br /><br />The floor of the crater is only 100 sq miles but is home to around 30,000 animals with a high concentration of predators and some of the finest black-maned lions in Africa. Rhinos can often be seen with calves at heel. Eland and waterbuck appear not to notice the human visitors, enabling photographers to shoot at ease. On the lake in the middle of the crater you may see thousands of flamingos fluttering and shimmering like a pink heat haze. Zebra and wildebeest account for almost half the animals. Gazelle, buffalo, eland, hartebeest and wart hog can also be seen.<br /></p>";

The camp offers spectacular views across Tortillis woodland situated on the edge of the short grass plains. The camp is comprised of nine double tents scattered around the kopje with the mess tent and common area as the central feature. Privacy between tents is guaranteed as they are at a substantial distance from each other and are generally concealed by a tree or kopje.<br /></p>";
