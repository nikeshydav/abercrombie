<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 12 Days & 11 Nights</p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong>	Most southerly country in the world.Enjoy the Vineyard</br>
From Atacama - The most arid desert on Earth to the ice fields of Patagonia in the South, on to Easter Island, the world’s largest open-air museum</br>

Bordered by the Andes the world’s second highest mountain range.</p>
</li>
<h5>ITINERARY</h5>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>Welcome to Chile!</h5>
<p>Upon your arrival at Santiago airport you will receive an exclusive meet & greet at the disembarking gate of your flight. Your local A&K guide will immediately assist you with immigration and custom formalities.  Later you will be assisted to connect with your flight to Calama, the gateway of your adventure in the Atacama Desert. </p>
<p>The quaint oasis town of San Pedro de Atacama sits in the driest desert in the world – Atacama – and is the main base for explorations in the area. This region was the principal center of the Atacamanian Indian culture, and relics such as Tulor, an ancient village estimated to have been built in 800 B.C., and the superb archaeology museum boasts hundreds of artifacts that have been well preserved by the desert's arid climate. But it is perhaps San Pedro's intangible magic that captivates its visitors in the end. San Pedro's streets have a pleasant, artistic, bohemian vibe, and its adobe buildings maintain a certain charm and unique character.</p>
<p>Upon arrival at the local airport of “El Loa” in the city of Calama, you will be welcomed by your local guide from Awasi lodge, for one hour transfer to San Pedro de Atacama, where your lodge is located. </p>
<p><strong>Awasi Lodge</strong></p>
<p>Each cottage of this small hotel is tastefully appointed, with generous spaces, private patio, a reading area, as well as indoor and outdoor showers. What really sets Awasi apart from the competition is the fact that for each cottage there will be a guide and 4x4 vehicle, making for the most personalized experience for guests. The aim of Awasi is simple; provide a luxurious environment from which one can admire the immensity of the Atacama Desert, while enjoying life's creature comforts. </p>
<p>Upon arrival at the hotel, you will enjoy your lunch at the lodge and your guide will be ready to explain you the different activities available for this afternoon. </p>
<p>In the evening return to the hotel for a <strong>private candle light dinner</strong>, follow by a <strong>stargazing tour</strong> at one of the clearest sky in the world.
    The special light conditions, crystal clear atmosphere and aridness of the Atacama Desert make it one of the finest places in the world for astronomical observation. This has led to the installation of important astronomical observatories in the area in the past few years such as the ALMA Project, which will be the world’s largest radio telescope. <strong>With the help of an expert</strong>, you will learn the basic concepts and history of astronomy. You will discover the ancestral Andean culture’s interpretation of the universe and the constellations, how they measured it and the legends they created around it.
    You will also learn the difference between traditional astronomy and radio astronomy, the objectives of the ALMA</p>
<p><strong>Overnight Stay:</strong> Awasi Lodge  </p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 02 & 03</h4>
<h5>San Pedro de Atacama</h5>
<p>You will have two days at leisure at Awasi lodge to enjoy any of the daily activities available to explore the Atacama Desert. Some of the activities available at your lodge are: <br>
        <p>    <strong>Toconao and Atacama Salt Lake : -</strong></p>
        <p>Description: The car leaves Awasi heading south on the paved road to the Salt Lake. After some 60 minutes we reach the town of Toconao, famous for its buildings of liparite volcanic stone. There, you can visit its historic church and bell tower and tour the stalls of craftspeople who offer their goods in the square. Next to Toconao is Jere creek, a canyon with the only running fresh water in these surroundings. This water has fed, since long ago, a true orchard of fruit trees and farmed vegetables. Then, continue on to Chaxa pond, a National Reserve located at Atacama Salt Lake. This pond is surrounded by salt crusts that result from the evaporation of salty ground water. In this setting you may observe the flamingoes that inhabit the Salt Lake, as well as other native bird species. This is undoubtedly a place of captivating beauty from which you can see the Domeyko Range, the Salt Range and the Andes Range, a panorama that becomes particularly splendid at dusk.</p>
<p>The ALevel of difficulty: Easy. <br>
       	What to bring along: Sunscreen, sun glasses; if the outing is in the afternoon: Windbreaker, full shoes (for all).<br>

<p>Description: Leave Awasi and head to the Natural Reserve, which is located some 15 minutes away in the middle of the Salt Range. Its name speaks of the magic of the landscape. As the tour progresses, you find lookouts from which to observe the unusual geological shapes which, together with the action of wind and water, have originated a land relief reminiscent of the inhospitable beauty of the lunar surface. The final moments of the sunset when, in a matter of seconds, luminous streaks bring out subtle coloring differences in the mountains, is simply indescribable.
Level of difficulty: Easy.
What to bring along: Sunscreen, sun glasses, hiking shoes.
Departure: In the afternoon.
Van trip: 25 miles (round trip).
Duration: 3,5 hours approx.
</p>
<p><strong>Cejar Pond</strong></p>
<p>Description: Leave Awasi by car and head to the northern part of the Atacama Salt Lake, crossing part of the Ayllu that are farthest from San Pedro, and then turn into a dirt road surrounded by sparse vegetation and remarkable dryness. After some 11 miles reach Cejar, a set of three ponds located in the middle of the Salt Lake in one of which you can bathe. Given its high degree of saltiness, you can not only float on the water but in fact cannot sink, a phenomenon similar to what you find in the Dead Sea (Israel). In this place you can watch birds that live in the Salt Lake zone, such as flamingoes and Andean gulls, and enjoy a privileged view of the surrounding ranges whose color contrasts with the deep blue of its waters. This outing is also optional on bicycle, a ride that takes approximately 1 hour and a half, returning to the Hotel by car.
Level of difficulty: Easy.
What to bring along: Sunscreen, sun glasses, bathing suit, sandals.
Departure: Morning or afternoon.
Van trip: 23 miles (round trip).
Duration: 3 hours approx.
</p>
<p><strong>Highland Salt Lakes </strong></p>
<p>Description: Highly recommendable, as there are few places in the highlands which offer such a variety. Leave Awasi heading south and visit the towns of Toconao and Socaire (10.600 ft). Along the way you will find different types of landscapes, which run from the driest dessert to small oases and mountain views. You will be able to see vicunas, among other wild species. You will be surprised by the immensity and inhospitable beauty of the Tuyajtu and Aguas Calientes salt lakes, with their turquoise colored ponds inhabited by ducks and flamingoes.
Level of difficulty: Easy, but requires prior adaptation to the altitude.
What to bring along: Sunscreen, sun glasses, warm clothing (jacket, long pants, full shoes, hat).
Departure: Morning
Van trip: 200 miles (round trip).
Duration: Full day.
</p>
<p><strong>Tatio- Puritama</strong></p>
<p>Description: We head north and gradually gain altitude as you cross the highland and observe the very rich flora & fauna of the place. After two hours on the road reach the Tatio Geysers, intermittent springs that gush out as imposing steam and hot water columns. After visiting the place you will have breakfast, enjoying the place and the peculiarity of its fumaroles. Before returning to Awasi, stop at the Puritama warm springs, where you can bathe and enjoy an appetizer (see Puritama).
Level of difficulty: Easy, but requires prior adaptation to the altitude.
What to bring along: Sunscreen, sun glasses, lots of warm clothing (jacket, long pants, full shoes, hat).
Departure: 6:00 / Return: 12:00pm
Van trip: 157 miles (round trip).
Duration: All day.
</p>
<p>During your stay in Atacama, enjoy an exciting experience surfing in the dunes of San Pedro de Atacama. Sanboard is a great experience not just because of the place, but also due to the strong feeling that you will get when you are going down in a dunes of 120 metres.  </p>

    Then you will continue to the San Antonio valley, Chile's newest and smallest D.O. and home to several new vineyards, such as <strong>Matetic vineyard.</strong></p>
<p>The Matetic family owns the entire Rosario valley Estate, which has a luxurious but rustic-looking guesthouse at one end, an impressive, hi-tech bodega at the other. The family history starts in Punta Arenas, at the end of the 19th century, with the arrival to Chile of Jorge Matetic Cetinja. Armed with a tremendous spirit of adventure, this Croatian immigrant sailed from Europe to settle in the far southern part of America. This same spirit of adventure is what led the company into the wine-growing business in 1999, in the firm belief that climatic characteristics associated with the kind of soil and light in this part of the country could produce high quality wines. How correct they were. Due to its geographic location, its temperate coastal Mediterranean climate has a strong ocean influence, with significant thermal fluctuations during the day - 20 degrees in the ripening period. The temperature normally rises quickly during the morning, until noon, when a soft ocean breeze helps maintain an average 26 degrees during the summer, a temperature that is ideal for the ripening of grapes. </p>
<strong>. Enjoy a private wine tasting before an exquisite lunch on the winery's restaurant.</strong>
<p>The rest of the afternoon is at leisure to enjoy the beautiful garden of the vineyard.

Dinner will be served at your lodge “La Casona of Vineyard Matetic”

<h5>Santiago / Easter Island </h5>
<p>In due to time, departure transfer for your hotel to the airport in Santiago to board your flight to Easter Island. </p>
<p>Discovered in 1722 on Easter Sunday (hence the name), Easter Island is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the most isolated place on the face of the Earth. At a distance of 3,700 km (2,300 miles) from the nearest populated point, which is the Chilean mainland. Although more Polynesian than South American in character, the 64-square mile island was annexed by Chile in 1888, and is now famous as the world’s largest ‘open air Museum’ on account of the Moai, or human-like stone statues, (more than 600 of them), that can be found on the island.  The Moai remain very much a mystery which archaeologists are still trying to unlock by interpreting an ancient language of the Rapa Nui, which is the key to understanding this culture, and is written on the so called ‘rongo rongo tablets’. However, its unique characters that run left-to-right one line and then the reverse on the next line are still undecipherable. </p>
<p>The island owes its origin to three volcanoes which erupted some three million years ago: Poike, Rano Kau and Maunga Terevaka. It is not known when or how the island was first populated, but the most credible theory suggests that the Rapa Nui people came from other Pacific islands in the 4th century AD.
In addition to the cultural and archaeological interest, there are the beautiful beaches, transparent waters and coral reefs that might be expected of a Pacific Island, and Jacques Cousteau himself agreed that it is one of the most perfect places for under-water marine studies.

Upon arrival to the local airport Mataveri, you will be welcomed with traditional floral collars and transfer to Explora Lodge, Posada Mike Rapu.
</p>

<p><strong>Explora Lodge, Posada Mike Rapu.</strong></p>
<p>On the mythical Easter Island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, Explora en Rapa Nui –Posada de Mike Rapu is located on a hill in the Te Miro Oone sector, on 9.6 hectares of land that faces the sea. The hotel is situated in the southwestern zone of the island, 5.6 km from Hanga Roa – the only town on the island – and it will act as a base for exploring this attractive and mysterious island, home to a culture whose origins and evolution remain unexplained. Volcanic rocks, native to the island and always used by the island’s inhabitants in construction, and wood from the mainland are the principal materials. The hotel has 30 guestrooms that spread out from central areas that house reception, living areas, a bar, kitchen and services. Next to the common areas is the “Casa de Baños” Hare Vai, with a pool, massage salon and open-air Jacuzzis.</p>

This<strong> afternoon your local A&K guide will assist you to dress your self as the local Rapa Nui People due, using the traditional body painting known as “Takona”</strong>. During traditional ceremonies Rapa Nui people paint their faces and bodies preserving the technique of mixing natural pigments and describing the meaning of the painting.  </p>
<p><strong>A sunset champagne toast will specially set atone of the amazing spot of the island.</strong> In the evening <strong>enjoy your dinner at the home of local Rapa Nui family.</strong> The key to understanding the history, myths and legends of this extraordinary place is surely meeting their people. Dining at the home of a local family, providing an unforgettable experience and true insight on everyday life on the island. This evening you will have the opportunity to savor the most typical Rapa Nui and Polynesian food, prepared in an earth-oven, locally called <strong>“UMU”.</strong> The curanto, or “UMU”, will be<strong> prepared by Maria Huke Rapahango,</strong> the matriarch of the family that will look after you during the dinner. Return to Explora Lodge. </p>

<p>Samba Dance Class at the prestigious dancing school of Carlinhos de Jesus. Rio de Janeiro is the birthplace of samba. It's impossible to resist the most Brazilian of all beats. You listen to it, and before you notice your feet are tapping, your fingers snapping! If only you knew how to dance it the way locals do... Well, you can. With a 2-hour lesson you'll be ready to do the basic samba steps and body movements, and before you know it you will be dancing really well! Tonight dinner will be at Rio Scenarium which if there was an award for most beautiful bar, it would certainly deserve it. Located in a renovated warehouse on the edge of Lapa, it is an antique store-turned-bar which serves a wide range of seafood and traditional Brazilian dishes. There is also a stage on the main floor where live Brazilian samba and choro bands will be playing as well as dance floor in case you want to samba the night away. This is the perfect place to practice the moves you learnt earlier today.</p>

<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>Rio de Janeiro-Florianopolis</h5>
<p>Morning at leisure to relax on the beach or linger at sidewalk cafes or take in an optional tour. In the afternoon, fly to Florianopolis. Upon arrival at Florianopolis airport, you will be met by your guide who will take you to paradise. The destination is "Ganchos". That's how it was baptized by its founders: Azorean immigrants who settled on this lush, mountainous, cove-studded peninsula, more than two hundred years ago at the height of the whaling boom. Some decades ago, the small city was renamed as Governador Celso Ramos. Protected from people's curiosity as by its topography, Ganchos has to this day remained one of the last surviving secrets of the Brazilian coast.</p>
<p>More than just natural beauty, a whole way of life has been preserved here. The colonists descendants still make their living from the sea – nowadays cultivating oysters, scallops and other shellfish.</p>
<p>You leave the main road behind and eight miles further on you find yourself winding along through a succession of villages strung along the north-facing peninsula as though frozen in time. Slow down. The coast road passes hard by the picturesque colonial style houses, as calm little bays come into view one by one, the water dotted with the simple boats and mollusk farmers colored buoys.</p>
<p>At the end of an unassuming lane, a gate will open to reveal the most amazing spot on the whole peninsula.</p>
<p>Welcome to Ponta dos Ganchos.</p>
<p>Be warned in advance: it’s not easy to leave the bungalow. Well, of course, the instant you call for one, an electric car will appear at your door in a flash. Nevertheless, sometimes it is going to be difficult to want to leave.<br>
It might be because of the therapeutic mattress or perhaps, it is because there are just too many threads in the Egyptian cotton sheets. Sometimes the espresso machine or the organic snacks next to it in the mini-bar are to blame.<br>
Other times it will be a combination of things – your private wine cellar will join forces with the view of the sunset over the bay to prevent you from venturing beyond the terrace. This is the reason why breakfast is like a miniature gourmet festival – a parade of delicacies served in dainty portions. Providing a little competition for the terrace of your bungalow is a little stone island just in front of the beach that you can reach swimming or along a catwalk.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Ponta dos Ganchos, Florianopolis</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>Ponta Dos Ganchos - Governador Celso Ramos</h5>
<p>Once you've become accustomed to the idea that the bungalows, with its creature comforts and its view, is always going to be there waiting for you, you will become more enthusiastic about venturing out. There is a wide selection of short trips, lasting from a couple of hours to a whole afternoon and that don’t involve leaving the peninsula. or going too far away from your whirlpool bath.<br>
A quick chat with the concierge will provide you with enough activity choices to keep you busy for this visit such as: visit to oyster farm, a walk along deserted beaches, a visit to the dolphins, beaches and forest on horseback, trip to waterfall by bike, diving with biodiversity, sport fishing and more.<br>
All activities are optional and not included in the program.</p>

<p>Buenos Aires is the birthplace of Tango, born in the brothels of the city, just before the beginning of the 1880s century. The word' Tango" refers to both a musical style and the dance performed to it. Tango, a dance known as passionate, sensual and very elegant, was all the rage in the 1930's in Buenos Aries and Paris. Tango is not only a dance but also an obsession. For the ´tanguero´, it is as much as a part of life as eating and sleeping. Erotic and passionate, haunting and melancholic, it involves not only the body but also the soul. Yes, it is just feeling - but in one dance, you can express sad, happy, angry, relax, deep, shallow, cheerful, sorrow, painful, serious, intellectual or just playful feelings. Tango has captured the popular imagination for over one hundred years to become no less than an international cult.</p>
