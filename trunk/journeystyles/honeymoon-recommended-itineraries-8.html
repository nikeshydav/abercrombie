<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 10 Nights</p>
<p>From the waterborne life on the winding Bangkok klongs to resort life on the island of Koh Chang, your journey to Thailand is filled with romantic sights and experiences. Gaze at tropical gardens and enjoy high tea in Bangkok, walk hand in hand through bamboo jungles and share days lounging on a secluded white sand beach or snorkeling to a hidden cove.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>India/Bangkok, Thailand</h5>
<p>On Arrival at Bangkok, Thailand's capital city, where you are met by your Abercrombie & Kent representative and provided with VIP assistance through customs and immigration procedures. Afterward, you are escorted to your hotel, set on the banks of the Chao Phraya River. At the legendary Mandarin Oriental, you can cool off in one of the lovely pools surrounded by tropical gardens, enjoy a game of squash, work out in the gym or visit the renowned spa. After having high tea in the hotel lobby lounge, the rest of the day is at your leisure.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Mandarin Oriental, Bangkok<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> None
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Bangkok</h5>
<p>As the sun rises across the river, you have the opportunity to privately make a food offering to the monks and receive a blessing of good karma in return. Afterward, travel along the river by private long-tailed boat through the busy klongs (canals) for a glimpse of the waterborne life in "the Venice of the East." Keep your eyes peeled and your camera ready as you pass by the Wat Arun (Temple of Dawn). Made of many pieces of cracked porcelain ornately carved out of sandstone, the temple seems to sparkle in the sunlight, while its rich images of demons, monkeys and guardians cast an eerie picture across the city. Disembark and go on a short ride by tuk-tuk (motorized tricycle) to the Grand Palace, one of the most beautiful examples of an ancient Siamese court. So small and distant that it can hardly be seen, little is known about the famous Emerald Buddha in sacred WatPhraKaew Temple, except that it is made of green jade or jasper and symbolizes the independence, strength and good fortune of the country. Visit the temple, whose interior walls are painted with superb frescoes. After an afternoon at leisure, you may want to take an optional sunset cocktail cruise on a local rice barge.
</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Mandarin Oriental, Bangkok<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3-5</h4>
<h5>Bangkok/Chiang Rai</h5>
<p>Fly to remote Chiang Rai, where you are escorted to your luxurious tented camp set deep in the heart of the Golden Triangle, where Thailand, Myanmar and Laos meet. Reached only by riverboat, the camp (your home for the next three nights) features just 15 freestanding, tented rooms set comfortably apart for privacy along a hillside trail in the Thai bamboo jungle. Your relaxed days here might include learning the basic skills of a mahout (trainer) at the on-site elephant camp. You may want to take a nature walk in the jungle and then pause for a picnic lunch in your lush surroundings, or glimpse the remote villages and life along the banks of the Mekong on a river safari. Perhaps take advantage of a rejuvenating treatment for two in one of the spa's open-air salas (treatment rooms) before settling down with a cocktail as you watch the sun dip over the horizon. Dinners are always an event at your camp, and during one of the evenings of your stay, enjoy a private, romantic meal in the wine cellar.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Four Seasons Tented Camp Golden Triangle<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>Chiang Rai/Chiang Mai</h5>
<p>Depart by private helicopter for Chiang Mai, where you check in to your resort hotel. Set in the breathtakingly beautiful Mae Rim Valley against the backdrop of the mountains, your resort is surrounded by 20 acres of landscaped tropical gardens and rice paddies. Your luxurious room has its own private outdoor sala that is ideal for absorbing the ambience and beauty of the area. This afternoon, learn how rice is grown when you join farmers in transplanting rice sprouts from the seedbed to the rice fields. Later this evening, head to Chiang Mai's famous Night Market, the largest and most colorful in Southeast Asia, to see a swirling kaleidoscope of merchants, entertainment and food carts.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Four Seasons Resort Chiang Mai <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>Chiang Mai</h5>
<p>Your day begins with a city tour of Chiang Mai, including a visit to the Waroros Market, a massive complex of stalls where you can find almost anything. Take a thrilling rickshaw ride through Chiang Mai's bustling streets to see the monastery of WatPhra Singh, passing the old city wall on the way. It is home to one of Thailand's most famous images: the mysterious and powerful Pra Buddha Sing (Lion Buddha). After an uphill ride along a hairpin switchback, you arrive at WatPrathat (DoiSuthep), tucked away in the mountains. Legend has it that a holy relic was placed on the back of an elephant, and where it stopped to rest, a temple would be erected. Sit down to a lunch of northern Thai specialties before returning to your resort.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Four Seasons Resort Chiang Mai<br />

</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 8</h4>
<h5> Chiang Mai/Bangkok/Koh Chang</h5>
<p>Board a flight to Trat Airport via Bangkok; then transfer to the pier for a short ferry ride to Koh Chang, Thailand's second-largest island. In addition to inviting, sandy beaches, Koh Chang's diverse landscapes include dense forests, waterfalls, mangroves and spectacular sites for diving that offer a myriad of activity options.

Along the way you’ll be able to spot from our sundeck birds like herons, kingfishers, and many others. The sounds of civilization are soon forgotten here – only the water and the myriad sounds of the surrounding rainforest. After the dinner, we’ll have the opportunity to go for a night walk into the forest to discover the mysteries of this unique environment and see how life emerges in the dark. <br>
In 1541, the very first Europeans set out from Quito to explore the dense jungles east of this ancient Incan capital in search of gold and cinnamon.  Not the jungle nor the natives ever revealed where the precious metal of "El Dorado" was to be found, as they floated for 800 miles down the Napo to come upon what they thought to be the Atlantic.  But it wasn't the Atlantic - yet.  It was the Great Amazon River, fed by over a thousand tributaries, emptying one third of the planet’s fresh water into the sea!
</p>
<p>Almost 500 years have passed since the discovery of this magnificent river system that flows through the world's largest primeval forest, containing 10% of all existing trees, 70% of all pharmaceutical compounds, and native Indians that live symbiotically with their unique ecosystem.  </p>
<p>This is the habitat of wildlife that is sure to be watching you - or vice versa - if you are lucky: 500 species of birds, half a dozen species of monkeys, caimans, tapirs, 2,500 species of butterflies and much more.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> M/V Anakonda</p>
</li>
<li>

Dolphins, common squirrel monkeys and much more. Pañacocha (Piranha Lake, in Quechua) is an ecosystem flooded by white waters. The rivers and lakes here are the perfect habitat for the infamous Piranha, as well as the Water Monkey Fish (Arawana) and White Caiman. After a refreshing swim (for the courageous!), we will enjoy a delicious Amazon-style BBQ meal and refreshing beverages at a nearby camping site. In the afternoon, we will head out on exploration 
trails, and return onboard for dinner. 
</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> M/V Anakonda</p>

    <h5>ITINERARY: </h5>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>Quito-La Mirage </h5>
<p>Welcome to Quito!</p>
<p>Upon arrival you will be transferred directly to La Mirage Garden Hotel & Spa.</p>
<p>From Quito, drive north through dramatic mountain landscapes dotted with tiny villages, and white churches to Cotachachi.

<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> La Mirage Garden Hotel & Spa
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>La Mirage</h5>
<p>After breakfast, we will visit Cuicocha, a crater lake located in the Western Cordillera of the Andes 25 kilometres west of Otavalo. “Cuicocha” is a Kichwa word meaning “Guinea Pig Lake”, a name given due to the shape of the large islands in the center of the lake.</p>
<p>Created 3,100 years ago by a massive eruption, the lake is three kilometers long and occupies a stunning setting with deep azure waters. You have the option of hiking along the ridge surrounding the lake; a trek which can last anywhere from 30 minutes to six hours depending on your ambitions and the schedule of the day.</p>
<p>We will enjoy a lunch in a local restaurant and make a stop in the village of Peguche to visit the home of Mr. José Luis Pichamba, whose family has a long lasting musical tradition. Your hosts will show you the process of crafting traditional instruments as well as demonstrate how to play them.  If you’re up for it, you can even try to play them yourself!  Peguche is also home to many of the area’s textile weavers. A visit to one of their workshops is easily arranged. Here, you will be able to see examples of the ancient weaving techniques to produce their famous textiles. </p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> La Mirage Garden Hotel & Spa</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>Otavalo-Quito </h5>
<p>Today we will visit the famous Otavalo market, the colorful and authentic produce market, which gives you the opportunity to see many of the unique fruits and vegetables of Ecuador. </p>
<p>We won’t leave without visiting the Plaza del Poncho, where the textile market is held. This is a real explosion of colors and smells. It is also interesting to see the vendors; they are dressed in a traditional way that shows the evolution and maintain of their identity.</p>
<p>After a lunch in Cusin, a very interesting Hacienda, beautifully decorated and with gardens hosting a lot of birds and local plants. We’ll then, leave to go to Quito.</p>
<p>Afternoon at leisure.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Plaza Grande Hotel</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>Quito- Galápagos </h5>
<p>Upon arrival at Baltra Airport, you will pass through an airport inspection point to ensure that no foreign plants or animals are introduced to the islands. You will be met and transferred to the M/V Grand Odyssey, where you will check in to your cabin.</p>
<p>PM: Cerro Dragon, Santa Cruz Island <br>
The north shore (dry landing) of Santa Cruz is home to Cerro Dragon (Dragon Hill). Its name) stems from the fact that this was one of the few sites on Santa Cruz Island where a healthy population of land iguanas were found when researchers came in 1975. Our walk includes a brackish lagoon frequented by lagoon birds, including stilts, pintail ducks, sandpipers, sanderlings and, occasionally, flamingos. Further inland, the trail offers a beautiful view of the bay and the western islands of the archipelago. This area is a natural nesting site for land iguanas, constantly monitored and assisted by the Charles Darwin Research Station. The arid-zone vegetation can be a rewarding location for bird watching, where Darwin’s finches, Galápagos mockingbirds, the endemic Galápagos flycatcher, and yellow warblers are regular sightings. You will have the chance to go swimming or snorkelling after the walk. Difficulty level: Moderate</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> M/V Grand Odyssey</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5/h4>
<h5>Galápagos</h5>
<p>AM: Black Turtle Cove, Santa Cruz Island <br>
Black Turtle Cove is one of the most beautiful marine sites in the Galapagos. It is a complex maze of tranquil salt-water inlets surrounded by three different species of mangrove.
</p>
<p>Its waters are a nursery site for sea turtles, rays, and sharks as well as a nesting site for sea birds. This site is only accessible by panga or kayak. </p>
<p>PM: Sombrero Chino Islet <br>
Less than a quarter-of-a-square-kilometre in size, the tiny island of Sombrero Chino (wet landing) gets its name from its unique appearance: similar to that of a Chinese hat. Lying just off the southeastern tip of Santiago Island, this islet was formed fairly recently and makes for a beautiful spot for scenic photographs. Explore along its 400-metre long trail, which begins at a crescent-shaped white sandy beach. Several species of shore birds can be spotted, along with marine iguanas, sea lions, lava lizards, Galápagos penguins, Darwin’s finches, and sally lightfoot crabs. The cove offers excellent swimming and snorkelling with sea lions and tropical fish in the tranquil blue waters. Kayaking is also an option. 
</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> M/V Grand Odyssey</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5> Galápagos </h5>
<p>AM: El Barranco, Genovesa Island <br>
Genovesa (dry landing) is the northernmost island that is allowed to be visited by naturalist (non-diving) cruises. 
</p>
<p>This island is extremely remote and home to literally millions of birds belonging to many different species including red footed boobies, frigate birds, swallow-tailed gulls, and even endemic owls! El Barranco, also known as Prince Phillip’s Steps, is a steep path (90 feet) with stairs carved into rock which leads to a plateau full of bird life amongst a Palo Santo forest. You will see Nazca boobies, Galapagos doves, mockingbirds, and storm petrels. With some luck, you may even spot a short-eared lava owl. Difficulty level: Moderate</p>
<p>PM: Darwin Bay, Genovesa Island <br>
Darwin Bay’s soft, coralline white sand (wet landing) is only the beginning of a spectacular excursion. An easy stroll from the beach takes you into lush mangroves where red footed boobies nest. As you’ll continue, you’ll observe thousands of birds, including frigate birds, Nazca boobies, swallow-tailed gulls, herons, finches, and mockingbirds. Snorkelling along the cliffs is a must here as sea lions, sharks, colourful reef fish, rays, and tortoises are common. You may also go out for a paddle in a sea kayak. 
</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> M/V Grand Odyssey</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>Galápagos</h5>
<p>AM: Bartolomé Island <br>
We discover a fascinating moonscape (dry landing) dotted with volcanic formations such as lava tubes and spatter, tuff, and cinder cones — as we hike up a short, yet somewhat steep trail.
</p>
<p>Along the way, we will also encounter pioneer plants, lava cactus, Scalesia plants, marine iguanas, and lava lizards. The view from the top is the true prize: iconic ‘Pinnacle Rock’ next to golden beaches and turquoise waters. Returning through dunes and mangroves, we reach the north shore. Beach time is a great opportunity to see and perhaps snorkel with Galapagos penguins, sea turtles, sea lions, rays, and white-tipped reef sharks among a great variety of colorful schools of fish. For many visitors, this may turn out to be their best snorkeling experience; the water here is generally clear, lacks large surf, and is full of marine life. Difficulty level: Moderate</p>
<p>PM: Sullivan Bay, Santiago Island <br>
This is the perfect place to see and feel the volcanic origin of Galápagos. You’ll arrive (wet landing) at a white coral sand beach and walk over lava that flowed here less than 100 years ago. Formed during an 1897 eruption, the lava was so hot that it essentially evaporated anything in its path, leaving only an imprint of what had been there before. It’s a stark, surreal, and strangely beautiful environment. One observer aboard a sailing vessel reported that the ship approached the lava flow so closely that the pine tar used to seal the hull of the ship began to soften, and the captain had to hurry the ship away from the bay. Snorkeling is possible at the end of the visit.
</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> M/V Grand Odyssey</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 8</h4>
<h5>Galápagos-Quito </h5>
<p>AM: Highlands, Santa Cruz Island <br>
The trail to the highlands leaves from Bellavista and passes through the agricultural zone, near the National Park boundary, the Miconia zone, and finally the fern and sedge zone.  The highlands are one of the best places in the islands to observe giant tortoises in their natural habitat. 
</p>
<p>The tortoises are easy to spot as they lumber around eating grass and leaves and wallowing in the small pools that are common in the area. They can weigh between 250 and 300 kg and live up to 150-200 years.  They have few natural enemies; their principal threat has always been humans. You may also spot some highland birds such as cattle egrets, Galápagos rails, mockingbirds, finches, and vermilion flycatchers. There are several lava tunnels nearby, a great place to spot the barn owl. There is also a small lagoon covered in red algae where gallinules and Galápagos pintails can be found. </p>
<p>After your visit to the highlands it will be time to depart to the airport for your return flight to Quito.</p>
<p>Transfer to your hotel and afternoon at leisure to enjoy Quito´s colonial night. </p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Plaza Grande Hotel</p>
