                                <h5>India/Turkey</h5>
                                <p>On Arrival at Istanbul, where you are met and provided VIP service through customs and immigration allowing a seamless arrival. Istanbul, at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, is a fascinating city, whose rich Byzantine and Ottoman history and culture combine with modern day bustle to create a metropolis that offers something for every interest. Your beautifully landscaped hotel is set on the banks of the Bosphorus; inside, find a state-of-the-art urban spa with an indoor pool and Turkish bath that offer wonderful opportunities for spending time together. Open-air venues - including an outdoor pool - face views of the city's magical monuments and the natural beauty of the sea.</p>

                                <h5>Istanbul</h5>
                                <p>Explore some of Istanbul's masterpieces of Byzantine and Ottoman architecture, beginning with the sixth-century Basilica Cistern. With its great acoustics, the structure today hosts classical music concerts. Visit the timeless Hagia Sophia, one of the greatest surviving examples of Byzantine architecture. Originally built as a church in 360, it has been a museum since 1935. The Turks ruled most of the Mediterranean and western Orient from the 15th-century Topkapi Palace. See it today, and then continue to the Pera district, the present-day heart of Istanbul. Early this evening, share special moments on a private sunset cruise of the Bosphorus. As you sail along, watch the beautiful skyline with its splendid mansions, Judas blossoms, forts and palaces.</p>

                                <h5> Istanbul</h5>
                                <p>The 16th century was the Golden Age of the Ottoman Empire, and the era's master architect was Sinan. Visit his Suleymaniye Mosque, dominating the skyline with its imposing dome. In the Ottoman world, pious mosque-school-bathhouse complexes sustained the social life of the community, and fabulous markets and bazaars powered the economic life. Visit Sinan's wonderful Rustem Pasa Mosque, known for its Iznik tiles. It is located next to the busy Spice Bazaar. Perhaps you can find a souvenir or two in its 88 vaulted rooms. After wandering through the bazaar, stop for a treat: a taste of Istanbul's best baklava and the opportunity to meet the master pastry chef. No mall is as dazzling as the 3,500-stall Grand Covered Bazaar, and you have a chance to walk through it looking for your own treasures. In the early evening, take the public ferry across the Bosphorus to Kadikoy's extensive public markets on the Asian side, watching the sun as it sets behind the magical domes and minarets. Stroll hand in hand through the markets to Ciya Restaurant, where you dine on exquisite traditional delicacies.</p>

                                <h5> Istanbul/Izmir/Ephesus/Sirince</h5>
                                <p>Fly to Izmir, the birthplace of Homer, and visit the remains of the great Ionian city of Ephesus, lying at the foot of Mount Pion. Unmatched as an archaeological site, the sheer size and grandeur of the ruins make this the best-preserved classical city in the eastern Mediterranean. Wander the archaeological park, the local museum and temple, and attend a private opening of the breathtaking Terrace Houses. For lunch, join a local family in their country restaurant for a hands-on lesson in Turkish cooking. Afterward, head to the beautifully preserved village of Sirince, resting on a curved gorge that overlooks endless olive groves reaching toward the Aegean Sea. Spend your night in an authentic cottage with wonderful views over the town, valley and surrounding mountains. Return to Ephesus this evening for an incredible opportunity and poignant event: an opportunity to renew your marriage vows in front of the Celsus Library. Officiated by a local priest and accompanied by the Izmir State Symphony, your wedding blessing becomes a powerful memory to cherish for a lifetime.</p>

                                <h5>Sirince/Izmir/Cappadocia</h5>
                                <p>Millennia-long volcanic activity and erosion turned the volcanic remains into a soft porous stone named tuff, creating a unique landscape in Cappadocia. The valleys of tuff filled with "fairy chimneys" became cave dwellings, monasteries, chapels and cellar villages at the hands of expert carvers. Fly to Cappadocia where you can explore this magical fairyland, marveling at the fascinating rock-carved churches and subterranean settlements. For lunch, travel by horse cart to a quiet place in the country for a picnic barbecue. Feast on a meze (an array of small plates) of salads, kebabs, fried chicken and lamb chops. Afterward, check in to your deluxe traditional Cappadocia hotel, partly carved into the tuff. Admire the antiques, elegant furniture, handmade wool and silk carpets used in the décor throughout the property. Then explore the rock-carved churches of Göreme, now an open-air museum displaying fine examples of ninth- and tenth-century Byzantine wall paintings. Later, privately visit the beautifully restored Dark Church and view its 11th-century frescoes before going on a hike in the famous Red Valley.</p>

                                <p>Wake with the sunrise and embark on a thrilling hot-air balloon ride over Cappadocia, looking down over the magical landscapes. When you return to land, celebrate with a champagne toast. After a late breakfast, explore another marvel of the region: the "underground city" at Kaymakli. The extensive network of rock-carved subterranean tunnels and hallways, storage and sleeping cells, airshafts and chapels, is more than 140 feet deep. With your guide, follow a lighted route and descend to 70 feet to view the mysterious passageways and dwellings. Then join a local farmer and his family for lunch in their home. This afternoon, visit Göreme Village Weavers Association, where young girls weave traditional rugs at home.</p>

Established in 1951, and covering an area of almost 15,000 sq km, an area comparable to the state of Connecticut or Northern Ireland, the Serengeti hosts a fantastically diverse ecosystem. The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, where 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other plains game that follow close behind, make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";

Transfer from Arusha to Ngorongoro Crater Lodge located on the rim with spectacular views across the crater. The Ngorongoro Crater is the largest unbroken caldera in the world and the first sight of it is breathtaking.<br /><br />Ngorongoro Crater Lodge is situated on the edge of the ancient crater rim above the cool, swirling mists. The lodge is a return to the noble elegance of the travelling colonials. Inspired in design by the Maasai Manyatta, three separate camps of 6 to 12 suites each remember a bygone era when characters such as Lord Delamere adorned the stilted, handcrafted structures with graceful antiques, grand chandeliers and treasures collected from travels through Africa.<br /><br /></p>";

<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 7 Nights</p>
<p> The land of the Kasbah's, busy ports, nomadic Berbers, high mountains and expansive desert offers a romantic escape from the world as you know it. Visit ancient mosques and walk hand in hand through lively city squares, follow mountain slopes and feel the breeze coming from picturesque lakes. Then share your nights in amazing kasbahs, palace hotels and intimate desert tents that all reflect the ambience of a bygone era.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>India/Casablanca, Morocco</h5>
<p>You are met on arrival and given VIP assistance in clearing customs formalities and collecting your luggage; then travel by private vehicle to your unique vintage townhouse hotel, located in the heart of the city. Originally settled by Berbers in the seventh century, Casablanca today is a bustling, French-influenced center. This afternoon, join your guide for a tour of this port city, stopping at the formidable Hassan II Grand Mosque. Its minaret is the tallest religious structure in the world, and part of the mosque's floor is glass, enabling worshippers to kneel directly over the sea. Enjoy dinner at Rick's CafÃ©, housed in a 1930's mansion and based on the cafÃ© everybody came to in the famous film Casablanca.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Le Doge <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,D
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Casablanca/Er-Rachida/Merzouga</h5>
<p>Meet your private A&K guide, an affable local resident and an expert on Morocco's culture and traditions, who accompanies you throughout your journey in Morocco. Board a charter flight to Er-Rachidia, and on arrival have lunch in Erfoud. Hop into a four-wheel-drive vehicle for a drive across the stunning Erg Chebbi Dunes to your exclusive A&K Desert Tented Camp in a remote area of the Sahara Desert. You are welcomed with mint tea and pastries and led to your private Moroccan caidal-styled tent that combines elements of Berber and Bedouin styles. Decorated with colorful carpets, it comfortably sleeps two, and has its own private bathroom with a shower and toilet next door. Set off on camelback in the evening and begin exploring the sand dunes. Return to your nomadic accommodations before sitting down to a Bedouin dinner served around the campfire.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Desert Tented Camp <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5> Merzouga/Erfoud/Skoura</h5>
<p>The drive today takes you across the southern slopes of the High Atlas range and through the Dades Valley. Along the way, stop at some of the many date palmeries and a small, private museum that houses exhibits showcasing local art, culture and history. Travel the "Road of a Thousand Kasbahs" and view the amazing 17th-century Amerhidl Kasbah; its faÃ§ade appears on the Moroccan 50-dirham note. After lunch, continue to your home for the next two nights - a luxurious 19th-century Kasbah that was part of a sultan's private hunting ground in the Skoura Oasis. Dar Ahlam means "house of dreams," and the name suits it well. Enter what seems like a dreamscape, where colorful veils, lanterns and candles - and only 12 rooms - ensure complete privacy, setting the mood for romance. Sit by the fireplace, surrounded by a kaleidoscope of colors; have lunch in the garden or olive grove; or dine in a secluded corner of the Kasbah or even on a hidden terrace.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Dar Ahlam<br />

</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>Skoura</h5>
<p>Not far from the desert oasis of Skoura is Ouarzazate Lake, where you take a walk and then sit down to a delightful picnic lunch on its shores. If you look across the lake you can see the mountains and desert; on a windy day, the waters toss and swell like the ocean. Afterward, return to your Kasbah for a refreshing swim and maybe a massage. This evening, savor a romantic dinner in an equally romantic setting: in the gardens under the almond trees, in the palm grove or on the riverbank.</p>

<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5> Skoura/Ouarzazate/Ait Benhaddou/Marrakech</h5>
<p>Spend some time wandering around Ouarzazate, a city originally built as a French garrison in the 1920s and now known for its pottery and carpets. Afterward, visit the Glaoui Kasbah of Taourit. One of Morocco's most beautiful Kasbahs, it consists of a network of luxury apartments, simple clay houses and crenellated towers decorated with geometric motifs. Continue to the fortified village of Ait Benhaddou, where some of the world's most elaborate and decorative kasbahs are found. See how they seem to defy the laws of gravity as they perch upon the sleep slope. Ait Benhaddou's charms have also reached all the way to Hollywood. Many popular movies, including Lawrence of Arabia, Jesus of Nazareth, Gladiator and The Mummy have been filmed here. After lunch in a local restaurant, continue to exotic Marrakech, the "Pearl of the South," and your Moorish-style palace hotel.</p>

<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>Marrakech</h5>
<p>Morocco's most famous city, Marrakech is veiled in mystery and magic. Visit the medina, the old walled section of the city, where most of the architectural attractions are located. Begin with a stop at Koutoubia Mosque and its 12th-century minaret, which dominates the local skyline. Make your way to vibrant Djemaa el-Fna, Marrakech's main square. Watch as fire-eaters, mime artists, snake charmers and street musicians perform at every turn. Continue walking and look for the Saadian Tombs, decorated in Granada-style carving and hidden away behind high walls. Discover how the privileged lived in the 19th century when you wander Bahia Palace to see the beautiful mosaics, fountains and courtyards. At the Museum of Moroccan Arts and Crafts, housed in the beautiful Dar Si Said palace, view stunning traditional woven carpets and Berber silver jewelry. Afterward, return to your hotel to experience a very important part of Moroccan culture and life: a hammam (steam bath). More than a steam bath, the hammam is a ritual. Soak in hot, soft water, lather up with a special penetrating black soap and exfoliate for revived skin. Follow up with a cold shower and an incredibly relaxing massage in a warm, darkened room - total bliss.</p>

While you have lunch at Sir Richard Branson's Kasbah Tamadot, admire the fabulous views of the mountains. Later this afternoon, return to your hotel for a relaxing massage. Conclude your romantic holiday with dinner for two served in a private room or under the stars in the hotel's garden</p>

Whether this is your first time on safari or a return trip the Serengeti will not disappoint.<br /><br />The Serengeti National Park is arguably the most famous national park in the world. The Serengeti perhaps defines the safari experience as surely as the wildlife that inhabits it. Established in 1951, and covering an area of almost 15,000 sq km, an area comparable to the state of Connecticut or Northern Ireland, the Serengeti hosts a fantastically diverse ecosystem. The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, where 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other plains game that follow close behind, make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";

The Selous supports around one million game animals, is bigger than Switzerland and is a World Heritage site.

The Ngorongoro Crater is the largest unbroken caldera in the world and the first sight of it is breathtaking.<br /><br />Ngorongoro Crater Lodge is situated on the edge of the ancient crater rim above the cool, swirling mists. The lodge is a return to the noble elegance of the travelling colonials. Inspired in design by the Maasai Manyatta, three separate camps of 6 to 12 suites each remember a bygone era when characters such as Lord Delamere adorned the stilted, handcrafted structures with graceful antiques, grand chandeliers and treasures collected from travels through Africa.<br /><br /></p>";

Rhinos can often be seen with calves at heel. Eland and waterbuck appear not to notice the human visitors, enabling photographers to shoot at ease. On the lake in the middle of the crater you may see thousands of flamingos fluttering and shimmering like a pink heat haze. Zebra and wildebeest account for almost half the animals.
