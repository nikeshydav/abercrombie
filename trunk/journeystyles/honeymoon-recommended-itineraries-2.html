<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 7 Nights</p>
<p>Italy captures classic romance like no other place in the world. This journey is a toast to your love as you traverse the canals of Venice in your own gondola, steal a kiss on Juliet's balcony in Verona, savor a private picnic in the heart of an Umbrian vineyard and explore Rome, a city so beautiful it gave romance its name. Fall in love all over again as you live the dolce vita of this sensual, beguiling country.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5> India/Venice</h5>
<p>Begin your romantic adventure by boarding an flight to Venice, one of the world's loveliest cities. On arrival, you are met by an Abercrombie & Kent representative and transferred to your hotel. Speed across the lagoon to your palace hotel, with a convenient location right on the city's Grand Canal. Arrive at the hotel - a 14th-century Venetian palace adorned with masterpieces by the likes of Tiepolo - by private jetty. This evening, take to Venice's famous canals as you cruise past the Santa Maraidella Salute Church and into the lagoon to toast the sunset and your romantic holiday with a glass of Veneto Prosecco. Continue to the beautiful island of Torcello, where a table is reserved for you in the delightful gardens at the LocandaCipriani. Savor one of their specialties: Adriatic fresh oysters.</p>

<p>Explore the less-visited side of "La Serenissima" (a fitting nickname for this most serene of Italian cities) alongside your expert local guide today. Lose yourselves in the charming labyrinth of narrow streets and passageways in the old artisans' quarter, where postcard-perfect scenes await around every corner. Wander through the Frari Church, which houses the breathtaking masterpieces of Titian, Bellini and Canova.

<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5> Venice/Verona</h5>
<p>Travel overland to the Roman city of Verona, the setting for Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. The family homes of the famous fictitious lovers are still standing, and today you have the chance for a private moment together on Juliet's balcony, perhaps even the opportunity to renew your wedding vows in this truly special location. Cap a lovely day with front-row seats at an epic opera performance al fresco in the Roman Arena, such as La Traviata (summer only). Tonight, overnight in the luxurious surroundings of a 13th-century palace.

Gaze at the tranquil beauty of Tuscany's Val d'Orcia, a spectacular sight to behold with your beloved. Enjoy a leisurely afternoon in medieval Assisi. You may wish to spend time in your hotel's spa, which sits within the 2,000-year-old Roman structure of the building. Your accommodations this evening are within a beautifully renovated convent, with incredible views over the dramatic Umbrian countryside.</p>

<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>South Georgia</h5>
<p>Today, travel deeper into the heart of the Umbrian countryside for one of the most memorable meals of your life. Dubbed the world's smallest restaurant, the one-of-a-kind Solo Per Due is dedicated to hosting and serving just you and your partner a dining experience tailored around your tastes and preferences. Your waiter serves on the call of your bell; otherwise, the restaurant and terrace are just for you, offering stunning views through Umbria's olive-tree clad hills. Continue to legendary Rome. Many say that the "Eternal City" is even more stunning as the sun goes down and the cityscape lights up. Alongside your guide and chauffeur, experience Italy's capital at night, touring the beautifully lit Trevi Fountain, Baths of Caracala and ancient Roman Forum before heading up to a lovely villa in the Borghese Gardens for the finale. At the top of the villa, champagne and canapés await you and your loved one to share in private as you gaze from your terrace out into the city that gave romance its name. Your romantic boutique hotel enjoys one of Rome's premier addresses, just across from the stunning Roman Colosseum.</p>

As soon as you arrive, enjoy a relaxing couple's massage in one of the private cottages on the island.

The Serengeti perhaps defines the safari experience as surely as the wildlife that inhabits it. Established in 1951, and covering an area of almost 15,000 sq km, an area comparable to the state of Connecticut or Northern Ireland, the Serengeti hosts a fantastically diverse ecosystem. The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, where 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other plains game that follow close behind, make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";
