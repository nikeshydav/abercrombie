<h5>Detailed Itinerary</h5>
<h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>ARRIVE VENICE–Cruise to a Torcello for a romantic dinner</h5>
<p>On arrival, you are met by a Guardian Angel and transferred to your hotel, where you will be assisted with check–in. Speed across the lagoon to your palace hotel, conveniently located on the city's Grand Canal. A 14th–century Venetian palace adorned with masterpieces by the likes of Tiepolo – by private jetty. </p>

<p>This evening, cruise on Venice’s famous canals as you pass the Santa Maraidella Salute Church and into the lagoon to toast the sunset and your romantic holiday with a glass of Veneto Prosecco. Reach the beautiful island of Torcello, where a table is set for you in the enchanting gardens at the Locanda Cipriani. Savor one of their specialties: Adriatic fresh oysters.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Ca' Sagredo<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> D
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>VENICE–Explore La Serenissima & a Gondola ride</h5>
<p>End your romantic adventure in one of the world's gorgeous cities & explore the less–visited side of "La Serenissima" (a fitting nickname for this most serene of Italian cities) alongside your Guardian Angel. Lose yourselves in the charming labyrinth of narrow streets and passageways in the old artisans' quarter, where postcard–perfect scenes await around every corner. Wander through the Frari Church, which houses the breathtaking masterpieces of Titian, Bellini and Canova. </p>

<p>This evening, your private gondolier rows and serenades you through the Grand Canal and under the Rialto Bridge on to a restaurant of your choice.</p>

<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Ca' Sagredo <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5> VENICE–VERONA–Visit to family home of Romeo & Juliet and Opera </h5>
<p>You will be transported by a private vehicle to the Roman city of Verona, the site for Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. A visit to the family homes of the famous fictitious lovers will give you the chance for a private special moment together on Juliet's balcony. Possibly even a chance to renew your wedding vows at this truly romantic and special location. We could even create an extra special moment for you by arranging for a private serenade! </p>

<p>Front–row seats at an epic opera performance al fresco in the Roman Arena, such as La Traviata (summer only) have been reserved especially for you. </p>

<p>Retire for the night in the lavish surroundings of a 13th–century palace. </p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Due Torri <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B, D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>VERONA–LAKE GARDA–Sight seeing</h5>
<p>Travel by your private vehicle through central Italy and the Tuscan countryside, a land of rolling vineyards and charming villas. Explore the region around Cortona, setting similar to a romantic novel and film. Enjoy the spectacular beauty of Tuscany with your beloved. </p>

<p>Another captivating place is at the border between Trentino, Veneto and Lombardy, the northern end of the lake which exhibits the evocative overhanging rocks of the Lombardy coast and the wonderful lakeshores of Veneto. Nature offers breathtaking views amidst high tree tops reflected in the deep blue of the lake.</p>

<p>Time is at leisure to explore Lake Garda’s eclectic identity.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Hotel Lido Palace<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>LAKE GARDA–Day at leisure and picnic</h5>
<p>Positioned on the dazzling gulf at the foot of Mt. Brione is Riva Del Garda. Explore its landscape and wide beaches which make it an ideal destination for a vacation. </p>

<p>Spend time in the city center at leisure. The city center’s impressive architecture maintains a link with the past. Riva Del Garda is one of the most important historical centres on the shores of Garda.</p>

<p>Lunch, head out to your own private spot with a picnic hamper in this truly amazing setting.</p>

<p>Evening at leisure</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Hotel Lido Palace<br />

<h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>ISTANBUL–At leisure</h5>
<p>On Arrival at Istanbul, you will be met by your A&K Representative, who will provide VIP service for customs & immigration. You will then be privately transferred to your hotel and be assisted with check-in. En route to your hotel drive by the periphery of the world’s most striking city walls. Constructed between 413 and 447 by Theodosius II, they were the greatest fortifications built up to their time, stretching more than four miles from the Golden Horn in the north to the Sea of Marmara in the south. Four Seasons, Bosphorus is a palace beautifully modified into a chic retreat, stunningly landscaped & surrounded by the azure waters and the mountain tops. </p>
<p>Day at leisure</p>
<p>Dinner reservations can be made at Maiden’s (or Leander’s) Tower, where you may enjoy drinks and dinner on the first-floor restaurant or the café, Kiz Kulesi. Dinner could be followed by some wine with your loved one on the top floor of this light house with awe inspiring views against the dark at the Kuledebar. Rising up on an islet in the middle of the Bosphorus, this former Ottoman lighthouse has inspired not one, but two legends. We strongly recommend a visit for a truly romantic experience.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Four Seasons Hotel, Bosphorus <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> None 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>ISTANBUL–Sightseeing & Private sunset cruise</h5>
<p>Explore some of Istanbul's masterpieces of Byzantine and Ottoman architecture, beginning with the sixth-century Basilica Cistern. Visit the timeless Hagia Sophia, one of the greatest living examples of Byzantine architecture. Originally constructed as a church in 360, it has been a museum since 1935. The Turks governed most of the Mediterranean and western Orient from the 15th-century Topkapi Palace. Later proceed to the Pera district, the present-day heart of Istanbul. </p>
<p>Early this evening, share memorable moments on a private sunset cruise of the Bosphorus. As you cruise along, view of the beautiful skyline is stunning with its splendid mansions, Judas blossoms, forts and palaces. To complete the day enjoy each other’s company over some wine, followed by dinner and entertainment all specially arranged for you on the cruise.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Four Seasons Hotel, Bosphorus <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B, D
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5> ISTANBUL–Trip to Buyukada & sightseeing</h5>
<p>You will be transported to Buyukada in a private boat. Buyukada is one of the Princes Islands in the Sea of Marmara. Cuddle up with your sweetheart in a horse-drawn buggy (private vehicles are not permitted on the island). Or stroll along the leafy boulevards lined with Ottoman-Victorian colonial houses. Enjoy a glass of wine at the café on the grounds of the famous St. George’s Church.</p>
<p>After lunch, you will be taken on a private guided half day sightseeing tour (4 hour) with your A&K Representative. The 16th century was the Golden Age of the Ottoman Empire, and the era's master architect was Sinan. Visit his Suleymaniye Mosque, dominating the skyline with its magnificent dome. In the Ottoman world, pious mosque-school-bathhouse complexes sustained the social life of the community, and magnificent markets and bazaars powered the financial life. Visit Sinan's splendid Rustem Pasa Mosque, well-known for its Iznik tiles, located close to the eventful Spice Bazaar. Perhaps you can locate a souvenir or two in its 88 vaulted rooms. After strolling around the bazaar, stop for a special treat, taste of Istanbul's best baklava and the chance to meet the master pastry chef. No mall is as alluring as the 3,500-stall Grand Covered Bazaar, and you have an opportunity to walk through it looking for your own treasures. </p>
<p>This evening, you could venture out to enjoy the famed nightlife of Istanbul.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Four Seasons Hotel, Bosphorus<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>ISTANBUL–IZMIR–EPHESUS–SIRINCE–Sightseeing, local cooking & renew your vows</h5>
<p>Fly to Izmir, the birthplace of Homer, and visit the remains of the great Ionian city of Ephesus, lying at the foot of Mount Pion. Unequaled as an archaeological site, the absolute size and grandeur of the ruins make it the best-preserved classical city in the eastern Mediterranean. Wander around the archaeological park, local museum and temple, and attend a private opening of the breathtaking Terrace Houses. </p>
<p>For lunch, join a local family in their country restaurant for a hands-on lesson in Turkish cooking. </p>
<p>Move ahead to the beautifully preserved village of Sirince, resting on a curved gorge that overlooks never-ending olive groves extending towards the Aegean Sea. Spend your night in an authentic cottage with brilliant views over the town, valley and surrounding mountains. </p>
<p>Return to Ephesus in the evening for a delightful opportunity and poignant event: a chance to renew your marriage vows in front of the Celsus Library. Authenticated by a local priest with the Izmir State Symphony in the background, your wedding blessing becomes a romantic and memory to be cherished for a lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Nisanyan Houses <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B, L</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5> SIRINCE–IZMIR–CAPPADOCIA–Picnic lunch & romantic dinner</h5>
<p>Your private chauffer will drive you to the airport in Izmir for your private charter flight to Cappadocia. Millennia-long volcanic activity and erosion turned the volcanic remains into a soft porous stone named tuff, which form the stunning landscape of Cappadocia. The valleys of tuff occupied with "fairy chimneys" were developed by expert carvers into cave dwellings, monasteries, chapels and cellar villages. </p>
<p>On arrival, you would be met & assisted to your luxurious traditional Cappadocia hotel, which is also partly carved into the tuff. Appreciate the antiques, elegant furniture, handmade wool and silk carpets that form a part of the interior décor throughout the property. </p>
<p>At your own pace sightsee the rock-carved churches of Göreme, now an open-air museum displaying fine examples of ninth and tenth-century Byzantine wall paintings. </p>
<p>Lunch, ride by horse cart to a quaint place in the country for a picnic barbecue. Feast on a mezze of salads, kebabs, fried chicken and lamb chops.</p>
<p>We suggest a romantic dinner at Sur Balık Restaurant, which offers new tastes in Cappadocia. Talented executive chefs concoct the Anatolian specialties beside the famous Red River of Avanos. </p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> The Museum Hotel <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B, L, D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>CAPPADOCIA–Hot air ballooning</h5>
<p>Wake with sunrise and get on board for a thrilling hot-air balloon ride over Cappadocia, looking down over the magical landscapes. When you land, celebrate with a champagne toast. After a late breakfast, explore another wonder of the region: the "underground city" at Kaymakli. The wide network of rock-carved subterranean tunnels and hallways, storage and sleeping cells, airshafts and chapels, is more than 140 feet deep. With your private guide, follow a lighted route and descend to 70 feet to explore the mysterious passageways and dwellings. </p>
<p>Lunch; join a local farmer and his family at their home for a taste of authentic and rustic cuisine. </p>
<p>This afternoon, visit Göreme Village Weavers Association, where young girls weave traditional rugs at home. </p>
<p>Or<br>
Evening, you can experience a special private massage session in one of the hidden and mystic valleys as part of our Valley Experiences. At offer are a variety of exclusive massages, such as our Ehl-i Massage, Cariye's Secret, Asian Silence, Sultan's Pleasure, Secret of Aphrodite, and Cappadocian Roses from menus (placed in your room)—all carried out with a professional and personal touch.

From March to May floods sweep the valley, forcing the game on to the 'islands' of higher ground, where elephant, buffalo, lion, leopard, crocodile, puku, buck, eland, sable and others concentrate.<br /></p>";

You may like to explore the Selous overland by 4WD vehicle or on a bush walk, or take to the river on a boat trip. Alternatively you may like to relax at your camp with a book on your private verandah or cool off in the camp's pool.<br /><br />The Selous is Africa's largest wildlife sanctuary and one of its least known treasures. Covering 21,000 square miles of completely undeveloped land, the Selous is one of the last great tracts of true wilderness left in Africa.<br /></p>";

Upon arrival at Arusha airport you will be met by your private driver/guide who will escort you for the duration of your safari in Tanzania. Transfer from Arusha to Ngorongoro Crater Lodge located on the rim with spectacular views across the crater. The Ngorongoro Crater is the largest unbroken caldera in the world and the first sight of it is breathtaking.<br /><br />Ngorongoro Crater Lodge is situated on the edge of the ancient crater rim above the cool, swirling mists. The lodge is a return to the noble elegance of the travelling colonials. Inspired in design by the Maasai Manyatta, three separate camps of 6 to 12 suites each remember a bygone era when characters such as Lord Delamere adorned the stilted, handcrafted structures with graceful antiques, grand chandeliers and treasures collected from travels through Africa.<br /><br /></p>";

From your lodge on the crater rim descend to the crater floor by 4WD safari vehicle for a morning unlike any other you will experience in Africa. Spot some of the rarer species in Africa like the black rhino against the spectacular backdrop of the crater's forest covered walls. Enjoy a picnic lunch amongst the hippos and birds before visiting a Maasai village this afternoon.<br /><br />The floor of the crater is only 100 sq miles but is home to around 30,000 animals with a high concentration of predators and some of the finest black-maned lions in Africa. Rhinos can often be seen with calves at heel. Eland and waterbuck appear not to notice the human visitors, enabling photographers to shoot at ease. On the lake in the middle of the crater you may see thousands of flamingos fluttering and shimmering like a pink heat haze. Zebra and wildebeest account for almost half the animals. Gazelle, buffalo, eland, hartebeest and wart hog can also be seen.<br /></p>";

The camp offers spectacular views across Tortillis woodland situated on the edge of the short grass plains. The camp is comprised of nine double tents scattered around the kopje with the mess tent and common area as the central feature. Privacy between tents is guaranteed as they are at a substantial distance from each other and are generally concealed by a tree or kopje.<br /></p>";
