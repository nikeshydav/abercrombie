<h5>Detailed Itinerary</h5>
<h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>ARRIVE TUSCANY–At leisure, massage and a 4 course candlelit dinner</h5>
<p>Your private chauffeur will drive you from Florence Airport to your hotel in the heart of the stunning Tuscan wine producing region of Chianti in a private vehicle.</p>
<p>
The ideal choice for both relaxation and exploration, the luxury sanctuary Castello Del Nero is located within striking distance of Florence and Siena. The carefully restored 12th century castle offers the absolute latest in modern facilities whilst maintaining the atmosphere of its historic surroundings.</p>

<p>Settle in & indulge in a Castello Del Nero Relaxation Ritual; a Balinese massage to help you unwind from the arrival journey.</p>

<p>Time at leisure to soak in the surroundings; followed by a 4–course candlelit dinner with tasting menu “The Tuscan Tradition” & selected beverages.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Castello Del Nero<br />
<strong>Meal plan:</strong> B
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5> TUSCANY–Wine & Dine Experience</h5>
<p>Wake up at leisure and get ready to enjoy your day in the amazing Tuscan countryside!</p>

<p>Your chauffeur will bring you into the heart of Chianti and perhaps one of the most beautiful wine regions in the world, Chianti Classico Wine Region is an area that has miles and miles of hill topped medieval villages and valleys covered in vines, all between the two beautiful cities of Florence and Siena.</p>

<p>You will begin in the vineyards and receive an explanation of the territory – the combination of local climate, soils and grape varietals that are the components that make wines so unique from region to region.</p>

<p>Enjoy an exclusive tour of the cellars; which could be followed by a Michelin starred lunchtime meal with accompanying fine delicious wines from the cellar. The sommelier will be happy to share his in–depth knowledge with you. Fully satiated, your chauffeur will bring you back to the paradise of your hotel.</p>

<p>Post lunch; enjoy the drive through the countryside. You could return to your hotel & perhaps stroll into the archetypal Tuscan village of Tavarnelle, just a short walk away.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Castello Del Nero <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>TUSCANY–Hot Air Ballooning & Countryside</h5>
<p>This morning by 5am you will be picked up and transferred to the launch site by your private vehicle between Florence and Siena.</p>

<p>You will soar over the renowned Chianti landscape with its hilltop towns, castles, valleys, famous vineyards, and mixed woodlands. On clear days at a distance you can view Florence to the North and the Apennine mountain range in the background; to the West you will see the Elsa valley, San Gimignano, Certaldo, and Volterra and the sea in the far distance; to the South, Poggibonsi, Colle Val d'Elsa and Siena and Monte Amiata in the distance; to the East the higher Monti del Chianti and mixed oak woodlands.</p>

<p>The flight is scheduled early morning just after dawn. Inflation takes about 30 minutes, and the flight approximately 1 hour depending on wind and weather conditions. After landing, the balloon will be loaded back onto the retrieving vehicle trailer that follows the balloon throughout the flight. Post the flight you enjoy a marvelous champagne breakfast with local produce.</p>

<p><em>Although flights are organised all year round, the "ballooning season" is approximately late spring to early autumn with annual variations. Weather in Chianti can be tricky and unpredictable, as all flights are subject to wind and weather, obviously these winter flights are not as regular as during the ballooning season.
    </em></p>
<p>After breakfast, you could wander throughout the countryside of Chianti and stop by Siena and Montepulciano.</p>

<p>Siena is possibly Italy's prettiest medieval city and a trip to Siena cannot be missed when in Tuscany. Siena's center of attraction is its central piazza known as Il Campo, famous worldwide for its Palio run here; a horse race run around the piazza twice every summer.</p>

<p>Enjoy the city & perhaps have lunch at another Michelin Star restaurant.</p>

<p>Post lunch, drive to the hill town of Montepulciano. Of all the region's small historic hill towns, Montepulciano has to be one of the most compelling. Standing imperious on its high tufa ridge, Montepulciano appears to have been artistically planned by a designer of Renaissance opera sets. Architecturally it is the most integral and unified historic centers of any Italian town: apart from a few restorations, no sizable construction work has taken place since 1580. You will find some good restaurants serving authentic hearty southern Tuscan fare, couple rustically elegant hotels, and the region which develops Tuscany's most serious, full–bodied red wines. But the town also has a certain discretion about it, a private side to its character that is very fascinating.</p>

<p>You could end the day with a lovely sundowner at a renowned restaurant overlooking the vineyards & soak in the amazing views of the Tuscan countryside at sunset.</p>

<p>Return to Castello Del Nero for the evening.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Castello Del Nero    <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>FLORENCE–Walking tour of the Oltrarno & Private tasting of artisan chocolates</h5>
<p>Morning is at leisure.</p>

<p>This afternoon meet your Guardian Angel for a half day walking tour (4 hours) of the Oltrarno – the delightful South side of the River Arno, where the medieval streets are lined with artisan workshops. From your hotel, cross over the Ponte Vecchio to the south side of the river admiring the gold and jewelry shops that line this famous bridge.

<p>Day is at leisure to explore the hotel facilities and local surroundings.</p>

<p>This evening, you could enjoy dinner at Trattoria Toscana, the only Alain Ducasse restaurant in Italy with a Michelin star. The interiors of the restaurant have a sense of discreet elegance and intimacy, with wooden beams, exposed brickwork, a fireplace and cotto tile flooring.

<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>TUSCANY–Spa & Thermal treatments</h5>
<p>Day is at leisure.</p>

<p>You could spend a day with your partner in the natural hot springs. Tuscany has great geothermal activity underneath its surface and hot springs are the most enjoyable result of this phenomenon.</p>

<p>You can spot several SPA and thermal treatment outlets throughout Tuscany. You may try the natural–hot water pools and waterfalls such the ones in Saturnia, Bagno Vignoni, Petriolo or San Filippo. During winter it’s weird to bathe in 40°C waters when outside its cold, but it’s undoubtedly an extremely pleasant experience, whichever season you’ll choose. Invite your partner to bathe with you in one of the small pools and surprise him/her lighting up some candles around during the night hours: you’ll always remember those magical moments!</p>

The Serengeti perhaps defines the safari experience as surely as the wildlife that inhabits it. Established in 1951, and covering an area of almost 15,000 sq km, an area comparable to the state of Connecticut or Northern Ireland, the Serengeti hosts a fantastically diverse ecosystem. The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, where 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other plains game that follow close behind, make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";

<h4>Day 9</h4>
<h5>HELSINKI–PORVOO–HELSINKI–City tour & Dinner at Savotta</h5>
<p>This morning, proceed for a Porvoo city tour. Porvoo is most famous for its charismatic cathedral, and for the picturesque Old Town. Sloping cobbled streets and lovely town square dominate the Old Town Hall. The square and surrounding streets are packed with attractive speciality stores selling handicrafts and works by local artisans. Porvoo's stone streets and painted wooden houses are wonderfully anachronistic and rustic; the town is even reachable by 1950s–style train from Helsinki.</p>
<p>Time at leisure </p>
<p>Dinner organised at an authentic Finnish restaurant, Savotta. The Restaurant Savotta transports its guests directly from Senate Square to a nostalgic view of Finland from past decades. Both the authentic interior and the dishes, served in original style, have been inspired by the Finnish forests and thousands of lakes, with a dash of Finnish “sisu” and logging traditions. </p>
<p>The old china designed by the world–renowned Arabia, the hundred–year–old floorboards, the old chairs and tables and many old artifacts have been brought from all over Finland. Each of them tells its own story from past decades and takes you back in time to the logging camps of the old days. </p>
