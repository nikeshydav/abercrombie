Quays, lakeside promenades, parks, elegant stores and lively streets and alleyways in the old part of town wait to be discovered. Boat trips beckon on the lake and the Rhone River. The Alps seem close enough to touch. Geneva - small metropolis surrounded by unspoiled nature and breath-taking scenery.</p>

<p>Built in three tiers, Lausanne has the sparkling blue waters of Lake Geneva at its feet, deep green forests at its back and snow-capped Alps in the distance. It is a city to explore with your senses, offering everything from quaint country markets to cosmopolitan shops and shows. A climb up to the Old City will take you to Lausanne's superb gothic cathedral, to the ancient castle of Saint Maire and to the university with its fine museums. Down by the waterside is the picturesque resort of Ouchy, where you can linger in one of the lakeside restaurants or visit the famous Olympic Museum. Continue to Montreux by coach. Montreux is the most frequented resort on Lac Leman (Lake of Geneva), thanks to its beautiful location and pleasant surrounding countryside. The city stretches gently along the shore of a wide, south-facing bay and rises above the lake like a huge amphitheatre amidst the wooded and vine-clad slopes. Montreux has attracted many visitors since the 18th century. Its palm trees give sample proof of its mild climate. The main features of the city tour is the Vieux Montreux (the old parts of the township) and, of course, the visit of the Castle of Chillon - one of the most impressive, medieval strongholds of Switzerland, immortalised by many famous poets.</p>

Whether this is your first time on safari or a return trip the Serengeti will not disappoint.<br /><br />The Serengeti National Park is arguably the most famous national park in the world. The Serengeti perhaps defines the safari experience as surely as the wildlife that inhabits it. Established in 1951, and covering an area of almost 15,000 sq km, an area comparable to the state of Connecticut or Northern Ireland, the Serengeti hosts a fantastically diverse ecosystem. The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, where 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other plains game that follow close behind, make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";

The Selous supports around one million game animals, is bigger than Switzerland and is a World Heritage site.

The Ngorongoro Crater is the largest unbroken caldera in the world and the first sight of it is breathtaking.<br /><br />Ngorongoro Crater Lodge is situated on the edge of the ancient crater rim above the cool, swirling mists. The lodge is a return to the noble elegance of the travelling colonials.

Rhinos can be seen with calves at heel. Eland and waterbuck appear not to notice the human visitors, enabling photographers to shoot at ease.
