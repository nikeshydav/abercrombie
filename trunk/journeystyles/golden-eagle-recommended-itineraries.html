<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 9 Days</p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong> Moscow, Kazan, Yekaterinburg, Novosibirsk, Iruktsk, Lake Baikal </p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>

<h5>Moscow</h5>
<p>Arrive at Moscow airport, where you are met and transferred to the luxurious five-star Marriott Royal Aurora hotel (or similar) located in the heart of this vibrant city for a one-night stay. We enjoy a welcome reception dinner at our hotel, whilst you meet your fellow travellers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Moscow</h5>
<p>Our morning city tour of Moscow principally takes us to Red Square, an iconic symbol of Russia's former military and political might. Here we see an eclectic mix of fascinating architecture, such as the ornate St Basil's Cathedral with its magnificent onion-domed spires, the grandeur of The Kremlin and the sombre and evocative site of Lenin's tomb. Early afternoon sees us boarding the luxurious Golden Eagle Trans-Siberian Express. After settling into our modern, stylish cabins, we enjoy dinner in one of the beautifully designed restaurant cars as our rail adventure eastwards to Lake Baikal begins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5> Kazan</h5>
<p>We arrive at the picturesque and historic city of Kazan by mid-morning. Situated on the River Volga, Kazan is the capital of Tatarstan. Here we have the opportunity to see for ourselves its rich tapestry of history and culture. One of the highlights of this city tour is our exploration of the Kremlin Fortress, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Within the walls of this ancient citadel we will explore its stunning mosque and onion-domed cathedral. After enjoying a relaxing dinner on the Golden Eagle, you may wish to retire to our welcoming bar car where you can enjoy drinks with new friends whilst listening to our resident pianist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>Yekaterinburg</h5>
<p>We cross the Europe/Asia divide before arriving in the historic city of Yekaterinburg. Founded in 1723 by Peter the Great, the third largest Russian city is also the capital of the Urals. The cultural and architectural influences of European and Asian civilisations come together in this fascinating and cosmopolitan landscape. Our city tour takes us to the poignant site where the Romanov, Nicholas II of Russia was executed with his family by the Bolsheviks in 1918. Now a church dedicated to their memory, this site provides us with a powerful insight into the turmoil of the Russian Revolution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5> Novosibirsk</h5>
<p>A modern 'Soviet' city, we experience the life and character of Novosibirsk's rich culture where the arts, science and literature predominate. Our city tour takes us to the Opera House. An architectural marvel, it houses two permanent ballet and opera companies and is the largest opera house in the world. In front of the Opera House, we visit an imposing statue of Lenin - a marvellous opportunity to have your photograph taken with this iconic political leader.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>Onboard</h5>
<p>A day to unwind and reflect on the many sights and sounds we have experienced on our journey so far. Chat to your fellow passengers, perhaps learn a few words of Russian or simply enjoy the ever changing landscape outside your window as it unfolds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>Irkutsk</h5>
<p>We arrive in Irkutsk, the 'Paris of Siberia', and our visit today takes in the most significant sites and museums in this fascinating city, including an exploration of the classic wooden architecture that has given many of this region's buildings such a distinctive and unique appearance. Next, we visit the Decembrist House museum which is dedicated to the memory of the exiled aristocrats who were forced to flee to this remote outpost after the failed revolution of 1825. Here we enjoy a private concert before returning to our waiting train for dinner.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 8</h4>
<h5>Lake Baikal</h5>
<p>Few natural sights can surpass the beauty and grandeur of Lake Baikal. For five hours we wind our way through tunnels along cliff hugging tracks above the lake with a vista of snow capped peaks along the far shore forming a picture-perfect backdrop. Lake Baikal is the deepest lake in the world and holds 20% of the world's freshwater. Also known as the 'Pearl of Siberia' it is home to a unique breed of freshwater seal and over fifty species of fish including omul which we will be serving in the dining car for some of our meals. Weather permitting, we stop at one of Baikal's picturesque and secluded bays to enjoy a delicious BBQ including freshly smoked fish prepared by our own chefs. For the brave hearted, there is even time for a refreshing swim in the crystal clear waters. In the afternoon, we visit Listvyanka, a small Baikal settlement nestling at the base of the surrounding hills. Tonight we return to Irkutsk and stay at the Marriot Courtyard Hotel (or similar) for your final evening.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 9</h4>
<h5>Irkutsk</h5>
<p>Following breakfast, you will be transferred to the airport to begin your journey home.</p>

Rhinos can be seen with calves at heel. Eland and waterbuck appear not to notice the human visitors, enabling photographers to shoot at ease. On the lake in the middle of the crater you may see thousands of flamingos, fluttering and shimmering like a pink heat haze.

<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 13 Days</p>
<p>Almaty, Tashkent, Samarkand, Bukhara, Merv, Ashgabat, Khiva, Kara Kum, Volgograd, Moscow</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>ALMATY</h5>
<p>Flights are met at Almaty Airport and guests are transferred to the centrally located five-star Inter-Continental Hotel for a one-night stay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>ALMATY, KAZAKHSTAN</h5>
<p>The city is set to play host to the 2011 Asian Winter Games after a failed bid to win the Winter Olympics is 2014.
Beautifully set in a valley in the foothills of the Tien Shen Mountains, we have lunch in a traditional Kazak 'yurt', a traditional dwelling place of the nomadic people of this region. Following our tour of Almaty, we will board the Golden Eagle this evening, and after settling into our cabins, we will enjoy our first dinner onboard.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>TASHKENT, UZBEKISTAN</h5>
<p>Today we spend a relaxing morning on board the train, socialising or maybe taking in one of the lectures and lessons on offer to give us a greater insight into this fascinating region. After lunch we arrive in the capital city of Uzbekistan and spend the afternoon touring this pleasant, modern, Soviet-style city, which was rebuilt after a devastating earthquake levelled it in 1966. After visiting the Museum of Fine Arts we have dinner on the train as it departs for Samarkand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>SAMARKAND</h5>
<p>Many words have been used to describe this jewel of the Islamic world, 'the Paris of the Muslim World' and 'Rome of the East'. Its admirers includes; Marco Polo, Tamerlane and Alexander the Great. Founded in the 6th century BC, its architecture gives an indication of its former status as one of the most important cities in Asia. We spend the day visiting the many fabulous buildings including the Bibi Kharum Mosque, the Ulag Beg observatory and the awe-inspiring Registan Square. Dinner is near the illuminated Registan Square, after which we return to the train for a late evening departure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>BUKHARA</h5>
<p>Traversing the Kyzyikum desert during the night we awake to the splendour of Uzbekistan's largest oasis city, Bukhara. Smaller than other cities in the country, it is perhaps just as, if not more, impressive as the larger Samarkand. Like Khiva UNESCO funded the renovation of much of the city for its 2,500th anniversary in 1999.
The highlight of our tour includes a visit to The Ark, the fortified residence of the Emirs of Bukhara, rulers infamous for their cruelty, and who survived into Soviet times. Lunch is within one of the city's many medressehs (beautifully-tiled Islamic schools). We then travel out of the city to visit the Emir's Palace of the Moon and Stars.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>MERV</h5>
<p>We arrive into Mary in the morning and transfer by bus to the ancient city of Merv. Once an important stop on the Silk Road, it is claimed that Merv was briefly the largest city in the world in the twelfth century before Merv was left to 'die' in 1794 after the Emir of Bukhara destroyed the dam which the population depended upon for water. On our tour we visit at least one of the five walled cities contained within the 50-square mile area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>ASHGABAT, TURKMENISTAN</h5>
<p>We arrive in the 'Las Vegas of the Kara Kum', the capital city of Turkmenistan, Ashgabat. A huge modern folly in the desert land which is a monument to the recently deceased President Sapamurat Turkmenbashi. Situated between the Kara Kum Desert and the Kopet Dag mountain range the scenery that forms the backdrop to the city is one of extremes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 8</h4>
<h5>KHIVA, UZBEKISTAN</h5>
<p>We cross back into Uzbekistan for our afternoon arrival in Urgench and transfer to this 2,500-year old city. Khiva was once one of the most important trading centres at the crossroads of the routes between Mongolia, Russia, China and Persia. Its former wealth is evident in the fabulous buildings, mosques, bazaars and minarets that are within the walled city and which have been restored with the support of UNESCO since 1991 for the city's 2,500th anniversary celebrations. Lunch is in the city and dinner on board the train.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 9</h4>
<h5>KARA KUM, KAZAKHSTAN</h5>
<p>We enjoy a relaxing day on board the Golden Eagle as we head through Kazakhstan's Kara Kum desert. As well as enjoying the scenery and the remote villages we briefly stop at from time to time there is also chance to relax in the bar car, chat to fellow passengers and maybe have a Russian language lesson.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 10</h4>
<h5>VOLGOGRAD, RUSSIA</h5>
<p>Situated on the banks of the Volga River, Stalingrad (as the city was known in Soviet times) was the scene of probably the most important battles in World War II. The Russians finally turned back the Nazi advance to the Caucasian oil fields in Baku at this city and turned the course of the Second World War. We visit the sobering Mamayev Kurgan war memorial, followed by the excellent diorama and museum. Tonight is our final evening on board the Golden Eagle and we mark the occasion with a farewell banquet.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 11</h4>
<h5>MOSCOW</h5>
<p>We arrive into Moscow late afternoon and transfer to the five-star Marriott Royal Aurora Hotel in the heart of the city for a two night stay.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 12</h4>
<h5>MOSCOW - FREEDOM OF CHOICE TOURING</h5>
<p>Our city tour of Moscow, principally takes us to Red Square, an iconic symbol of Russia's former military and political might. Here we see an eclectic mix of fascinating architecture, such as the ornate St. Basil's Cathedral with its magnificent onion-domed spires, the grandeur of The Kremlin and the sombre and evocative site of Lenin's tomb. With our Freedom of Choice touring options you may instead wish to visit, for example, the Tretyakov Gallery (National Museum of Russian Fine Art). At the conclusion of our city tour, our final evening is spent saying our goodbyes to our fellow travelling companions at the Farewell Dinner.

</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 13</h4>
<h5>MOSCOW</h5>
<p>Following breakfast in the hotel, you will be transferred to Moscow airport to begin your journey home.

Alternatively, we will offer a visit to the Han Yangling Museum. This tomb dating back 2,000 years with its adjoining museum is one of China's finest undiscovered secrets. Early evening we head back to the city for dinner and the excellent Tang Dynasty show.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>Lanzhou</h5>
<p>A morning arrival into Lanzhou; a vital city on the Silk Route due to its principal crossing point of the mighty Yellow River. A visit to the Gansu Provincial Museum here provides evidence of the kind of goods that moved in an Eastward direction along the Silk Route and the famous 'galloping horse' dating from the Eastern Han period that was found in a nearby tomb. A late afternoon departure is followed by dinner this evening onboard the train.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>Dunhuang</h5>
<p>We arrive in the small oasis city of Dunhuang to visit the fascinating Magao Thousand Buddha Cave Complex. Containing almost 500 grottoes, carved between 700 and 1,700 years ago, they are filled with an amazing collection of sculptures and murals depicting the evolution of Buddhist religious art over a 1,000-year period. Over 2,000 statues and 45,000 murals still remain. We have lunch with a local folk performance in this magical setting. In the afternoon we take a camel ride to one of the natural wonders of the Gobi Desert, Crescent Lake, which has been a source of water among the incredible sand dunes for thousands of years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 8</h4>
<h5>Turpan & Urumchi</h5>
<p>This morning we visit Turpan with the Flaming Mountains as its stunning backdrop. We will see the centuries old underground irrigation system that feeds the rich orchards and vineyards, and the fascinating deserted sand city of Jiaohe. This afternoon we drive to Urumchi which is located in a green oasis between the lofty ice-capped Bogda Peak, the vast Salt Lake in the east, the rolling pine-covered Southern hill and the alternating fields and sand dunes of Zunggar Basin in the northwest. It is the largest city and one of the most spell binding in the western half of China. Our city tour this afternoon includes the renowned Mummies Exhibition in the Provincial Museum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 9</h4>
<h5>Crossing to Kazakhstan</h5>
<p>After a final breakfast onboard the Chinese train, we pass through the dramatic mountain scenery of Druzhba before arriving in Alashankou, where border controls are carried out. The border crossing takes five hours and patience is a virtue! We transfer to our waiting Golden Eagle private train for the continuation of our journey to Moscow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 10</h4>
<h5>Almaty, Kazakhstan</h5>
<p>Just after breakfast we arrive in the largest city in Kazahkstan, Almaty. The city is set to play host to the 2011 Asian Winter Games after a failed bid to win the Winter Olympics is 2014. Beautifully set in a valley in the foothills of the Tien Shen Mountains, we have lunch in a traditional Kazak 'yurt', a traditional dwelling place of the nomadic people of this region. After dinner this evening we can listen to the resident pianist in our comfortable bar car whilst enjoying a drink with new friends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 11</h4>
<h5>Tashkent, Uzbekistan</h5>
<p>Today we spend a relaxing morning on board the train, socialising or maybe taking in one of the lectures and lessons on offer to give us a greater insight into this fascinating region. After lunch we arrive in the capital city of Uzbekistan and spend the afternoon touring this pleasant, modern, Soviet-style city, which was rebuilt after a devastating earthquake levelled it in 1966. After visiting the Museum of Fine Arts we have dinner on the train as it departs for Samarkand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 12</h4>
<h5>Samarkand</h5>
<p>Many words have been used to describe this jewel of the Islamic world, 'the Paris of the Muslim World' and 'Rome of the East'. Its admirers includes; Marco Polo, Tamerlane and Alexander the Great. Founded in the 6th century BC, its architecture gives an indication of its former status as one of the most important cities in Asia. We spend the day visiting the many fabulous buildings including the Bibi Kharum Mosque, the Ulag Beg observatory and the awe-inspiring Registan Square. Dinner is near the illuminated Registan Square, after which we return to the train for a late evening departure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 13</h4>
<h5>Bukhara</h5>
<p>Traversing the Kyzyikum desert during the night we awake to the splendour of Uzbekistan's largest oasis city, Bukhara. Smaller than other cities in the country, it is perhaps just as, if not more, impressive as the larger Samarkand. Like Khiva UNESCO funded the renovation of much of the city for its 2,500th anniversary in 1999. The highlight of our tour includes a visit to The Ark, the fortified residence of the Emirs of Bukhara, rulers infamous for their cruelty, and who survived into Soviet times. Lunch is within one of the city's many medressehs (beautifully-tiled Islamic schools). We then travel out of the city to visit the Emir's Palace of the Moon and Stars.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 14</h4>
<h5>Merv</h5>
<p>We arrive into Mary in the morning and transfer by bus to the ancient city of Merv. Once an important stop on the Silk Road, it is claimed that Merv was briefly the largest city in the world in the twelfth century before Merv was left to 'die' in 1794 after the Emir of Bukhara destroyed the dam which the population depended upon for water. On our tour we visit at least one of the five walled cities contained within the 50-square mile area.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 15</h4>
<h5>Ashgabat, Turkmenistan</h5>
<p>We arrive in the 'Las Vegas of the Kara Kum', the capital city of Turkmenistan, Ashgabat. A huge modern folly in the desert land which is a monument to the recently deceased President Sapamurat Turkmenbashi. Situated between the Kara Kum Desert and the Kopet Dag mountain range the scenery that forms the backdrop to the city is one of extremes.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 16</h4>
<h5>Khiva, Uzbekistan</h5>
<p>We cross back into Uzbekistan for our afternoon arrival in Urgench and transfer to this 2,500-year old city. Khiva was once one of the most important trading centres at the crossroads of the routes between Mongolia, Russia, China and Persia. Its former wealth is evident in the fabulous buildings, mosques, bazaars and minarets that are within the walled city and which have been restored with the support of UNESCO since 1991 for the city's 2,500th anniversary celebrations. Lunch is in the city and dinner on board the train.

</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 17</h4>
<h5>Kara Kum, Kazakhstan</h5>
<p>We enjoy a relaxing day on board the Golden Eagle as we head through Kazakhstan's Kara Kum desert. As well as enjoying the scenery and the remote villages we briefly stop at from time to time there is also chance to relax in the bar car, chat to fellow passengers and maybe have a Russian language lesson.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 18</h4>
<h5>Volgograd, Russia</h5>
<p>Situated on the banks of the Volga River, Stalingrad (as the city was known in Soviet times) was the scene of probably the most important battles in World War II. The Russians finally turned back the Nazi advance to the Caucasian oil fields in Baku at this city and turned the course of the Second World War. We visit the sobering Mamayev Kurgan war memorial, followed by the excellent diorama and museum. Tonight is our final evening on board the Golden Eagle and we mark the occasion with a farewell banquet.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 19</h4>
<h5>Moscow</h5>
<p>Having travelled almost 7,000 miles (11,226km) from Beijing we arrive into Moscow late afternoon and transfer to the five-star Marriott Royal Aurora Hotel in the heart of the city.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 20</h4>
<h5>Moscow with Freedom of Choice Touring</h5>
<p>Our city tour of Moscow, principally takes us to Red Square, an iconic symbol of Russia's former military and political might. Here we see an eclectic mix of fascinating architecture, such as the ornate St. Basil's Cathedral with its magnificent onion-domed spires, the grandeur of The Kremlin and the sombre and evocative site of Lenin's  tomb.  With  our  Freedom  of  Choice  touring  options  you  may  instead  wish  to  visit,  for  example,  the Tretyakov Gallery (National Museum of Russian Fine Art). At the conclusion of our city tour, our final evening is spent saying our goodbyes to our fellow travelling companions at the Farewell Dinner.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 21</h4>
<h5>Moscow</h5>
<p>Following breakfast in the hotel, you will be transferred to Moscow airport to begin your journey home.

<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 13 Days</p>
<p> Moscow, Volgograd, Kara Kum, Khiva, Ashgabat, Merv, Bukhara, Samarkand Tashkent, Almaty </p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>Moscow</h5>
<p>Arrive at Moscow airport, where you are met and transferred to the luxurious five-star Marriott Royal Aurora hotel (or similar) located in the heart of this vibrant city for a two-night stay. We enjoy a welcome dinner at our hotel, whilst you meet your fellow travellers and, together, look forward to the 13 day voyage that lies ahead. (Please note there will be a main group of travellers on the tour that will travel from Moscow to Beijing as a 21 day journey)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Moscow</h5>
<p>Our city tour of Moscow principally takes us to Red Square, an iconic symbol of Russia's former military and political might. Here we see an eclectic mix of fascinating architecture, such as the ornate St Basil's Cathedral with its magnificent onion-domed spires, the grandeur of The Kremlin and the sombre and evocative site of Lenin's tomb.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>Onboard</h5>
<p>In the morning of Day 3, we board the Golden Eagle Trans-Siberian Express. After settling into our modern, stylish cabins, we enjoy dinner in one of the beautifully designed restaurant cars as our rail journey to Almaty in Kazakhstan begins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>Volgograd</h5>
<p>Standing on the banks of the Volga, Stalingrad, as the city was known in Soviet times, was the dramatic scene of some the most important Second World War battles. The Russians heroically turned back the Nazi advance here to alter the course of the war. We visit the poignantly sobering Mamayev Kurgan war memorial, followed by the informative diorama and absorbing museum visit. In the evening we enjoy a beautifully prepared dinner on board our private train.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5> Kara Kum</h5>
<p>Today, we enjoy a relaxing day onboard as we travel across the vast expanses of the Kara Kum desert. As well as experiencing the unique landscape, we can take the opportunity to chat to fellow passengers and maybe take our first Russian language lesson.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>Khiva</h5>
<p>Crossing into Uzbekistan, our train travels towards Urgench, where we transfer to the ancient city of Khiva, founded 2,500 years ago. As one of the Silk Road's most important trading posts and now a World Heritage Site, it lies at the crossroads of the routes between Mongolia, Russia, China and Persia. A truly magnificent sight to behold, it rises out of the desert to reveal a wealth of impressive architecture. Stepping back in time, we discover its impressive mosques, bazaars and minarets within Khiva's ancient walls. Lunch and dinner are served onboard our train.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>Ashgabat</h5>
<p>In dramatic contrast to Khiva, we arrive in Ashgabat, capital of Turkmenistan - the 'Las Vegas of the Kara Kum'. Situated between the Kara Kum Desert and the Kopet Dag mountain range, its golden domes and towering modern buildings appear strangely incongruous in this almost biblical setting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 8</h4>
<h5> Merv</h5>
<p>Early morning sees us arrive in Mary, where we transfer to the ancient and mainly unrestored city of Merv. Once an important stopping point on the Silk Road, it claims to have briefly been the largest city in the world during the twelfth century. 1794 saw the demise of Merv, after the Emir of Bukhara destroyed the dam which the population depended on for its water. After our fascinating exploration we return to our train for dinner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 9</h4>
<h5>Bukhara</h5>
<p>Bukhara is quite simply outstanding. Like Khiva, UNESCO helped fund the renovation of much of the city for its 2,500th anniversary in 1999. The highlight of this wonderful tour is a visit to The Ark, a fortified residence of the Emirs of Bukhara - the despotic and ruthless leaders who ruled until Soviet times. Lunch is taken at a local restaurant before we travel out of the city to experience the Emir's enchantingly named, Palace of the Moon and Stars.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 10</h4>
<h5>Samarkand</h5>
<p>Founded in the 6th Century BC, Samarkland's stunning architecture hints at its former status as one of the most important cities in Asia. Today we will visit some of its most significant sites including the refined elegance of the beautifully proportioned Bibi Khanum Mosque and the Ulag Beg observatory, one of the earliest Islamic astronomical observatories built in 1428. Before dinner in a local restaurant we will visit the illuminated and awe-inspiring Registan Square before returning to our train for a late evening departure.

</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 11</h4>
<h5>Tashkent</h5>
<p>Today we arrive in the capital city of Uzbekistan and spend the morning touring this modern Soviet-style city which was rebuilt following the devastating earthquake of 1966. We re-board the train for lunch as we head towards Kazakhstan and Almaty. This afternoon gives us the opportunity to relax with friends or listen to one of the informative lectures designed to give us a greater insight into this fascinating region before we enjoy our final evening on board the Golden Eagle.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 12</h4>
<h5>Almaty</h5>
<p>Just before lunch we arrive in Almaty - the largest city in Kazakhstan. This beautifully verdant city derives its name from 'Alma' meaning 'apple'. Just a short distance from the city, apple orchards thrive in abundance.
Surrounded by the majesty of the Tien Shen Mountains, we will enjoy a traditional lunch in a Kazak 'yurt', a dwelling place of this region's nomadic people. Tonight we transfer from the Golden Eagle to the 5 star Inter-Continental Hotel for a 1 night stay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 13</h4>
<h5>Almaty</h5>
<p>After breakfast, transfer to the Almaty International Airport for your onward flight home.</p>

Enjoy a full day exploring the Serengeti by 4WD vehicle with thrilling morning and afternoon game drives. Whether this is your first time on safari or a return trip the Serengeti will not disappoint.<br /><br />The Serengeti National Park is arguably the most famous national park in the world. The Serengeti perhaps defines the safari experience as surely as the wildlife that inhabits it. Established in 1951, and covering an area of almost 15,000 sq km, an area comparable to the state of Connecticut or Northern Ireland, the Serengeti hosts a fantastically diverse ecosystem. The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, where 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other plains game that follow close behind, make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";

The Selous supports around one million game animals, is bigger than Switzerland and is a World Heritage site. From March to May floods sweep the valley, forcing the game on to the 'islands' of higher ground, where elephant, buffalo, lion, leopard, crocodile, puku, buck, eland, sable and others concentrate.<br /></p>";

Transfer from Arusha to Ngorongoro Crater Lodge located on the rim with spectacular views across the crater. The Ngorongoro Crater is the largest unbroken caldera in the world and the first sight of it is breathtaking.<br /><br />Ngorongoro Crater Lodge is situated on the edge of the ancient crater rim above the cool, swirling mists. The lodge is a return to the noble elegance of the travelling colonials. Inspired in design by the Maasai Manyatta, three separate camps of 6 to 12 suites each remember a bygone era when characters such as Lord Delamere adorned the stilted, handcrafted structures with graceful antiques, grand chandeliers and treasures collected from travels through Africa.<br /><br /></p>";

Rhinos can often be seen with calves at heel. Eland and waterbuck appear not to notice the human visitors, enabling photographers to shoot at ease. On the lake in the middle of the crater you may see thousands of flamingos fluttering and shimmering like a pink heat haze. Zebra and wildebeest account for almost half the animals.
