<h3>Vikram Madhok<br />
Managing Director</h3>
<p>Educated at St Columba's School, Delhi, and Mayo College, Ajmer, he earned a commerce degree from Hansraj College in Delhi before flying off to southern California to do an MBA. He was only 22 when he completed his studies and as with every young man, he too was faced with the unenviable task of choosing a fruitful career. </p> 

<p>Eventually, he settled for banking and worked with Citi Financial, a part of Citigroup, in America for four years. It was a boring job and it was boredom, along with an urge to return home that saw him board a flight to India in 1985. With four years of banking behind him he could carry on as a banker in India, if there were no other options.</p>

<p>However, consumer banking was then only arriving in India, and he soon realised that the work standards he was accustomed to in the US would take some time to hit our shores. Not wanting to take a wrong step, he spoke to his friends in Delhi before zeroing in on the hospitality industry as he thought hoteliering would be a far more interesting job.</p>

<p>So Taj Hotels it was. Starting off as a sales executive, he rose within the ranks, to leave the company after four years as a product manager. Next he worked with the Oberoi Group as a marketing manager and spent eight long years there to become a corporate director before he decided to quit the industry altogether. </p>

<p>The reason for quitting the hospitality industry was that he wanted to sell destinations to clients. "Hoteliering didn't let him do that and realising that tourism was only beginning to take flight in India, he crossed over once again to join Abercrombie & Kent India in 1997. Tourism was his next playing field and he had justification for industry hopping - "Be it banking, hospitality or tourism, he has always remained a services' person. That's the sector he began with, and that's where he shall continue for a good 20 years more.</p>



<p>We have a specialised team of travel consultants on hand to answer all your travel queries and offer advice on destinations around the world. Our travel consultants regularly visit all the destinations we cover and experience the A&amp;K difference first hand to offer our clients' unparalleled knowledge and a travel service that is second to none.</p>
