<h3>Geoffrey Kent<br />
Founder, Chairman and CEO</h3>
<p>Geoffrey Kent is the Founder, Chairman and CEO of the Abercrombie &amp; Kent Group of Companies. Born in 1942 in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) , Geoffrey grew up on the family farm in the Aberdare Highlands of Kenya. His childhood was filled with the bush lore and drama of untamed Africa sowing the seeds which would develop into the two great passions of his life: a thirst to explore uncharted territory and the desire to excel.</p>
<p>At 17, Geoffrey succeed in traversing the continent from Kenya to Cape Town, South Africa becoming the first individual to complete the 5,000-mile route on a motorbike. After attending the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst, Kent saw service in such far-flung countries as Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Yemen, Cyprus, Libya and Malta. His distinguished armed forces career was cut relatively short as a result of hearing damage from years spent in heavy tanks. In 1966, Geoffrey succeeded his father at the helm of A&amp;K, a luxury safari operation in Nairobi. His energy, business acumen and foresight enabled the company to develop into internationally renowned luxury travel powerhouse that it is today, with over 60 offices worldwide.</p>
<p>In conjunction with Jorie Butler Kent, Geoffrey founded Friends of Conservation, an international organisation seeking to preserve the world's endangered natural environment, marshalling local support to find rational solutions to ecological problems. Responsible tourismis integral to the A&amp;K company philosophy. In October 2006, Geoffrey Kent was appointed Chairman of the WTTC, the chief forum for business leaders in the Travel &amp; Tourism industry. He is also a Council member of the Prince of Wales's Business Leader's Forum.</p>

<h2>A&amp;K India Team</h2><br />
<div class="AboutImg"><img src="../images/vm.jpg" alt="Vikram Madhok"  /></div>
<h3>Vikram Madhok<br />
Managing Director</h3>
<p>Educated at St Columba's School, Delhi, and Mayo College, Ajmer, he earned a commerce degree from Hansraj College in Delhi before flying off to southern California to do an MBA. He was only 22 when he completed his studies and as with every young man, he too was faced with the unenviable task of choosing a fruitful career. </p> 

<p>Eventually, he settled for banking and worked with Citi Financial, a part of Citigroup, in America for four years. It was a boring job and it was boredom, along with an urge to return home that saw him board a flight to India in 1985. With four years of banking behind him he could carry on as a banker in India, if there were no other options.</p>

<p>However, consumer banking was then only arriving in India, and he soon realised that the work standards he was accustomed to in the US would take some time to hit our shores. Not wanting to take a wrong step, he spoke to his friends in Delhi before zeroing in on the hospitality industry as he thought hoteliering would be a far more interesting job.</p>

<p>So Taj Hotels it was. Starting off as a sales executive, he rose within the ranks, to leave the company after four years as a product manager. Next he worked with the Oberoi Group as a marketing manager and spent eight long years there to become a corporate director before he decided to quit the industry altogether. </p>

<p>The reason for quitting the hospitality industry was that he wanted to sell destinations to clients. "Hoteliering didn't let him do that and realising that tourism was only beginning to take flight in India, he crossed over once again to join Abercrombie & Kent India in 1997. Tourism was his next playing field and he had justification for industry hopping - "Be it banking, hospitality or tourism, he has always remained a services' person. That's the sector he began with, and that's where he shall continue for a good 20 years more.</p>
