<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 4 Days</p>
<p>A special 4 day tour of the French capital, exploring all the main sights of one of the most romantic cities in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight</strong>: Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe, Champs ElysÃ©es, Notre Dame Cathedral, Versailles </p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>ARRIVE PARIS</h5>
<p>Upon arrival at Paris airport you will be met in the arrival hall by your driver and privately transferred to your hotel.
You will find a complimentary bottle of champagne in your room upon your arrival to celebrate the beginning of your mini-moon.</p>
<p>On the Rue de Rivoli overlooking the beautiful Tuileries Gardens, the Hotel Meurice boasts an excellent location in the heart of Paris as it is nestled between the Place de la Concorde and the Grand Louvre. Also nearby are the OpÃ©ra Garnier, the Jewellery stores on the rue de la Paix, and the Place VendÃ´me. Original antiques and paintings are featured throughout the hotel and every floor is decorated in a distinctive style.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Hotel Le Meurice
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>PARIS</h5>
<p>This morning you will enjoy a half day (4 hours) sightseeing tour in Paris with your private vehicle and English-speaking guide. This overview tour will include famous Parisian sights such as the Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe, Champs ElysÃ©es and the Ile de la CitÃ©, where you will visit the beautiful Notre Dame Cathedral.</p>
<p>This afternoon is at your leisure - you may like to explore Montmartre. This district is forever associated with the idealistic Bohemian lifestyles of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Parisians call it the 'Butte' (knoll) as it is the highest point in the city. Discover Montmartre's romantic charms along the winding back streets, small squares and terraces. Many artists paint quick-fire portraits in the 'Place du Tertre'. Walk up to the SacrÃ©-Coeur Basilica for spectacular views over the city. Other famous landmarks of Montmartre include the 'Moulin Rouge', a 19-century windmill transformed into a world-famous cabaret and immortalized by the painter Toulouse-Lautrec, the 'Place des Abbesses', a picturesque square which is now a hub of the fashion world, or the DalÃ­ Centre, a unique exhibition entirely devoted to the master of surrealism, and more particularly to his sculptures and engravings.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Hotel Le Meurice <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>PARIS - VERSAILLES - PARIS</h5>
<p>Enjoy a full-day (up to 8 hours) excursion tour to Versailles with your private vehicle and English-speaking guide. Situated to the west of Paris, Versailles is the location of the huge palace that was constructed in the 17th century for Louis XIV, the 'Sun King'. It became the model for grand houses of royalty all over Europe. Take a tour of the opulent State Apartments that culminate in the magnificent Gallery of Mirrors.</p>
<p>Enjoy a stroll in the formal ornamental gardens that are embellished with many fountains, and see the Grand Canal that stretches into the distance across the park; a beautiful spot to indulge in an intimate picnic for two which has been especially prepared for you. Return to Paris following your visit.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Hotel Le Meurice<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>

<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 7 Nights</p>
<p> The land of the Kasbah's, busy ports, nomadic Berbers, high mountains and expansive desert offers a romantic escape from the world as you know it. Visit ancient mosques and walk hand in hand through lively city squares, follow mountain slopes and feel the breeze coming from picturesque lakes. Then share your nights in amazing kasbahs, palace hotels and intimate desert tents that all reflect the ambience of a bygone era.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>India/Casablanca, Morocco</h5>
<p>You are met on arrival and given VIP assistance in clearing customs formalities and collecting your luggage; then travel by private vehicle to your unique vintage townhouse hotel, located in the heart of the city. Originally settled by Berbers in the seventh century, Casablanca today is a bustling, French-influenced center. This afternoon, join your guide for a tour of this port city, stopping at the formidable Hassan II Grand Mosque. Its minaret is the tallest religious structure in the world, and part of the mosque's floor is glass, enabling worshippers to kneel directly over the sea. Enjoy dinner at Rick's CafÃ©, housed in a 1930's mansion and based on the cafÃ© everybody came to in the famous film Casablanca.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Le Doge <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,D
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Casablanca/Er-Rachida/Merzouga</h5>
<p>Meet your private A&K guide, an affable local resident and an expert on Morocco's culture and traditions, who accompanies you throughout your journey in Morocco. Board a charter flight to Er-Rachidia, and on arrival have lunch in Erfoud. Hop into a four-wheel-drive vehicle for a drive across the stunning Erg Chebbi Dunes to your exclusive A&K Desert Tented Camp in a remote area of the Sahara Desert. You are welcomed with mint tea and pastries and led to your private Moroccan caidal-styled tent that combines elements of Berber and Bedouin styles. Decorated with colorful carpets, it comfortably sleeps two, and has its own private bathroom with a shower and toilet next door. Set off on camelback in the evening and begin exploring the sand dunes. Return to your nomadic accommodations before sitting down to a Bedouin dinner served around the campfire.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Desert Tented Camp <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5> Merzouga/Erfoud/Skoura</h5>
<p>The drive today takes you across the southern slopes of the High Atlas range and through the Dades Valley. Along the way, stop at some of the many date palmeries and a small, private museum that houses exhibits showcasing local art, culture and history. Travel the "Road of a Thousand Kasbahs" and view the amazing 17th-century Amerhidl Kasbah; its faÃ§ade appears on the Moroccan 50-dirham note. After lunch, continue to your home for the next two nights - a luxurious 19th-century Kasbah that was part of a sultan's private hunting ground in the Skoura Oasis. Dar Ahlam means "house of dreams," and the name suits it well. Enter what seems like a dreamscape, where colorful veils, lanterns and candles - and only 12 rooms - ensure complete privacy, setting the mood for romance. Sit by the fireplace, surrounded by a kaleidoscope of colors; have lunch in the garden or olive grove; or dine in a secluded corner of the Kasbah or even on a hidden terrace.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Dar Ahlam<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>Skoura</h5>
<p>Not far from the desert oasis of Skoura is Ouarzazate Lake, where you take a walk and then sit down to a delightful picnic lunch on its shores. If you look across the lake you can see the mountains and desert; on a windy day, the waters toss and swell like the ocean. Afterward, return to your Kasbah for a refreshing swim and maybe a massage. This evening, savor a romantic dinner in an equally romantic setting: in the gardens under the almond trees, in the palm grove or on the riverbank.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Dar Ahlam<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5> Skoura/Ouarzazate/Ait Benhaddou/Marrakech</h5>
<p>Spend some time wandering around Ouarzazate, a city originally built as a French garrison in the 1920s and now known for its pottery and carpets. Afterward, visit the Glaoui Kasbah of Taourit. One of Morocco's most beautiful Kasbahs, it consists of a network of luxury apartments, simple clay houses and crenellated towers decorated with geometric motifs.

<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>Marrakech</h5>
<p>Morocco's most famous city, Marrakech is veiled in mystery and magic. Visit the medina, the old walled section of the city, where most of the architectural attractions are located. Begin with a stop at Koutoubia Mosque and its 12th-century minaret, which dominates the local skyline. Make your way to vibrant Djemaa el-Fna, Marrakech's main square. Watch as fire-eaters, mime artists, snake charmers and street musicians perform at every turn. Continue walking and look for the Saadian Tombs, decorated in Granada-style carving and hidden away behind high walls. Discover how the privileged lived in the 19th century when you wander Bahia Palace to see the beautiful mosaics, fountains and courtyards. At the Museum of Moroccan Arts and Crafts, housed in the beautiful Dar Si Said palace, view stunning traditional woven carpets and Berber silver jewelry. Afterward, return to your hotel to experience a very important part of Moroccan culture and life: a hammam (steam bath). More than a steam bath, the hammam is a ritual. Soak in hot, soft water, lather up with a special penetrating black soap and exfoliate for revived skin.

Established in 1951, and covering an area of almost 15,000 sq km, an area comparable to the state of Connecticut or Northern Ireland, the Serengeti hosts a fantastically diverse ecosystem. The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, where 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other plains game that follow close behind, make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";
