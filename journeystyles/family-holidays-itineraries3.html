<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p>Watch for the revered "Big Five," embark on an exciting scavenger hunt and enjoy a picnic lunch near the hippo pool at Ngorongoro Crater on this fun-filled Family adventure visiting three game parks.</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 8 Days</p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong> &bull; Enjoy the services of a Children's Activity Coordinator, who travels with the group and organizes activities for all age levels<br />
&bull; Embark on a family treasure hunt through a famous market in the Ngorongoro Highlands<br />
&bull; Visit with an elder at a Maasai village to learn about the traditional ways of these nomadic people<br />
&bull; Children participate in a special game drive during their stay in the Serengeti</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>

<h5>Arrive Arusha, Tanzania</h5>
<p>Arrive by overnight flight to Tanzania, where your unforgettable wildlife adventure unfolds. On your adventure, you can view animals up-close from inside an extinct volcano and meet a longstanding local tribe to learn about their traditions and culture.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Serena Mountain Village</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Arusha/Tarangire National Park</h5>
<p>Travel by road to Tarangire National Park, made up of eight distinct vegetation zones varying from swamps to open grasslands and acacia parkland. The variety of landscapes allows many animal and bird species to thrive. The park has an exceptional elephant population and the highest recorded number of breeding bird species for any habitat in the world. Settle in to your lodge, and then set out on an afternoon game drive. This evening, Abercrombie & Kent hosts a welcome dinner.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Tarangire Sopa Lodge<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B L D</p>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>Tarangire National Park</h5>
<p>Morning and afternoon game drives take you through the landscapes of Tarangire, which change from baobab tree forests and swamps to flat plains dotted with distinctive, thorny acacia trees. The most outstanding feature in the park is the Tarangire River. It is the only reliable dry-season source of water available to wildlife in a vast stretch of Tanzania's Rift Valley, attracting tremendous concentrations of animals. Look for unique species including eland, fringe-eared oryx, greater kudu and the elusive wild dog. Tarangire is also home to giraffes, waterbucks, wildebeest and zebras.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Tarangire Sopa Lodge<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B L D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>Tarangire/Ngorongoro Crater</h5>
<p>Leave Tarangire and travel overland to the Ngorongoro Crater, stopping at Mto wa Mbu, home to over 90 tribes. Wander through Mto wa Mbu Market - the setting for a scavenger hunt. With your money and a list of items, roam the stalls and bargain for the goods on your list. Continue to Gibb's Farm, where you sit down to a farm-fresh lunch, with fruit and vegetables from the farm's organic garden. To work off your lunch, you may want to walk to a nearby waterfall that weaves in and out of the forest; see caves made by elephants; or just take a stroll in the farm's beautiful gardens. From there, go on to the Ngorongoro Crater. Considered among the natural wonders of the world, the 2,000-foot-deep caldera is the result of a collapsed volcanic eruption and is a haven for many species of animals and birds. Arrive at your lodge, perched on the crater's rim, offering spectacular views across this natural amphitheater.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Ngorongoro Sopa Lodge<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B L D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5> Ngorongoro Crater</h5>
<p>Descend into the Ngorongoro Crater, searching for lions, elephants, hyenas, wildebeests and gazelles. Even the rare and elusive black rhinoceros, one of Africa's most endangered species, is a resident here. (One species you won't see is the cheetah - the crater's hyenas chased them out long ago.) Bird lovers can view flamingos and other species that share the shallow waters with big game. You may also see Maasai herdsmen walking with their cattle - the crater is in their territory, and the Maasai continue to coexist with wildlife as they have for centuries. Learn more of the Maasai's ways by visiting a local village. Notice how the Maasai women do all of the work - even build the houses. Stop for a picnic lunch near the hippo pool and watch resident hippos lazing in the river.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Ngorongoro Sopa Lodge<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B L D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>Ngorongoro Crater/Serengeti National Park</h5>
<p>After breakfast, leave Ngorongoro and fly to Serengeti National Park. Arrive at your Maasai-style lodge, where the comfortable guest rooms overlook the Serengeti plains. This afternoon, set off on your first game drive in the park. Famed throughout Africa and around the world, its 10,000 square miles support a variety of animals, including lions, leopards, hyenas, cheetahs, giraffes and topi. Each year, the Serengeti is the scene of the spectacular seasonal wildebeest and zebra migration, when millions of these animals trek through to Kenya's Masai Mara in search of fresh grass and water. The sight of so many animals, from the air or on the ground, is an awe-inspiring experience.
</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Serengeti Sopa Lodge<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B L D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>Serengeti National Park</h5>
<p>Embark on an optional hot air balloon ride over the boundless Serengeti plains, just as animals begin to stir. Watch below as graceful giraffes lope along, seemingly in slow motion, or see if you can locate elephant families rolling in the mud of a watering hole. The Serengeti's diverse terrain supports an equally wide array of flora and fauna, which you see firsthand during today's game drives. The Serengeti ecosystem is one of the oldest on earth, where climate, vegetation and fauna have barely changed in the past million years. This evening, all travelling families gather for a farewell dinner - it's the perfect time to swap stories about memorable sightings and toast a never-to-be-forgotten stay.
</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Serengeti Sopa Lodge<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B L D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 8</h4>
<h5>Serengeti/Arusha/Depart</h5>
<p>Fly back to Arusha, where you may relax in your dayroom before your international flight. You can also walk around the beautiful grounds, go mountain biking or take a canoe ride.

<p> <strong>Overnight:</strong> 'Eclipse' <br /> 
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B L D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3-8</h4>
<h5>The Galapagos</h5>
<p>Lying about 600 miles off the coast of Ecuador, the Gal�pagos Islands are a haven for some of the world's most varied wildlife. It was this diversity that first led naturalist Charles Darwin to propose that species evolved in response to their environment. Darwin's work also helped to alert the world to the need - urgent even in his own day - to preserve these islands from degradation by humans. Today, tourism to the Gal�pagos is closely managed, and your visit adheres to the strictest standards of
environmental responsibility. Because weather, water and wildlife conditions are subject to constant change, your islands itinerary is not fixed, but two daily excursions are planned to the main sites and islands, which vary depending on the route you choose. You may explore landmarks such as Punta Espinoza on Fernandina Island, the volcanoes of Isabela Island, El Barranco on Genovesa Island, Pinnacle Rock on Bartolome Island and the Charles Darwin Research Station on Santa Cruz Island. Each cruise day begins with an early breakfast, perhaps taken al fresco on 'Eclipse's' spacious deck. You then board a sturdy rubber raft called a panga for the morning shore excursion.</p>
<p>As soon as your feet touch terra firma, expect to spot flora and fauna (all different depending on the island), take photographs and confer with your naturalist guide. See sunbathing sea lions; skittering Sally Lightfoot crabs; tangles of marine iguanas; penguins, finches, terns and blue-footed boobies overhead and underfoot; even a century-old tortoise diligently trudging over the sand. Return to 'Eclipse' for a refreshing lunch, followed by time at leisure to nap or socialize on deck. Keep your binoculars close by for a possible sighting of whales or seabirds. In the afternoon, return to the pangas for the second excursion of the day, perhaps with an opportunity to swim, kayak or snorkel. Back on board 'Eclipse' for the evening, there is time to shower and relax before gathering in the dining room for another wonderful meal.</p>
<p>In the evening, your time is your own: attend a lecture on board by one of your affable guides, recapping the day's sights and gaining a sneak peek at tomorrow's itinerary; explore the mysteries of the night sky with a fascinating astronomy lecture on deck; peruse the ship's excellent library; or gather for cocktails in the lounge to cap a day of extraordinary discoveries.</p>
<p> <strong>Overnight:</strong> 'Eclipse' <br /> 
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B L D </p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 9</h4>
<h5>The Galapagos/Guayaquil</h5>
<p>Disembark today and fly to Guayaquil, where the remainder of your evening is at leisure. Reminisce on your journey with fellow guests during a farewell dinner tonight.</p>
<p> <strong>Overnight:</strong> Hilton Colon Guayaquil <br /> 
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B D</p>

<h4>Day 10</h4>
<h5>Depart Guayaquil</h5>

Established in 1951, and covering an area of almost 15,000 sq km, an area comparable to the state of Connecticut or Northern Ireland, the Serengeti hosts a fantastically diverse ecosystem. The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, where 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other plains game that follow close behind, make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";

The Ngorongoro Crater is the largest unbroken caldera in the world and the first sight of it is breathtaking.<br /><br />Ngorongoro Crater Lodge is situated on the edge of the ancient crater rim above the cool, swirling mists. The lodge is a return to the noble elegance of the travelling colonials.

The camp is comprised of nine double tents scattered around the kopje with the mess tent and common area as the central feature. Privacy between tents is guaranteed as they are at a substantial distance from each other and are generally concealed by a tree or kopje.<br /></p>";
