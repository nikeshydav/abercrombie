<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 9 Days</p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong> Moscow, Kazan, Yekaterinburg, Novosibirsk, Iruktsk, Lake Baikal </p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>

<h5>Moscow</h5>
<p>Arrive at Moscow airport, where you are met and transferred to the luxurious five-star Marriott Royal Aurora hotel (or similar) located in the heart of this vibrant city for a one-night stay. We enjoy a welcome reception dinner at our hotel, whilst you meet your fellow travellers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Moscow</h5>
<p>Our morning city tour of Moscow principally takes us to Red Square, an iconic symbol of Russia's former military and political might. Here we see an eclectic mix of fascinating architecture, such as the ornate St Basil's Cathedral with its magnificent onion-domed spires, the grandeur of The Kremlin and the sombre and evocative site of Lenin's tomb. Early afternoon sees us boarding the luxurious Golden Eagle Trans-Siberian Express. After settling into our modern, stylish cabins, we enjoy dinner in one of the beautifully designed restaurant cars as our rail adventure eastwards to Lake Baikal begins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5> Kazan</h5>
<p>We arrive at the picturesque and historic city of Kazan by mid-morning. Situated on the River Volga, Kazan is the capital of Tatarstan. Here we have the opportunity to see for ourselves its rich tapestry of history and culture. One of the highlights of this city tour is our exploration of the Kremlin Fortress, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Within the walls of this ancient citadel we will explore its stunning mosque and onion-domed cathedral. After enjoying a relaxing dinner on the Golden Eagle, you may wish to retire to our welcoming bar car where you can enjoy drinks with new friends whilst listening to our resident pianist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>Yekaterinburg</h5>
<p>We cross the Europe/Asia divide before arriving in the historic city of Yekaterinburg. Founded in 1723 by Peter the Great, the third largest Russian city is also the capital of the Urals. The cultural and architectural influences of European and Asian civilisations come together in this fascinating and cosmopolitan landscape. Our city tour takes us to the poignant site where the Romanov, Nicholas II of Russia was executed with his family by the Bolsheviks in 1918. Now a church dedicated to their memory, this site provides us with a powerful insight into the turmoil of the Russian Revolution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5> Novosibirsk</h5>
<p>A modern 'Soviet' city, we experience the life and character of Novosibirsk's rich culture where the arts, science and literature predominate. Our city tour takes us to the Opera House. An architectural marvel, it houses two permanent ballet and opera companies and is the largest opera house in the world. In front of the Opera House, we visit an imposing statue of Lenin - a marvellous opportunity to have your photograph taken with this iconic political leader.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>Onboard</h5>
<p>A day to unwind and reflect on the many sights and sounds we have experienced on our journey so far. Chat to your fellow passengers, perhaps learn a few words of Russian or simply enjoy the ever changing landscape outside your window as it unfolds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>Irkutsk</h5>
<p>We arrive in Irkutsk, the 'Paris of Siberia', and our visit today takes in the most significant sites and museums in this fascinating city, including an exploration of the classic wooden architecture that has given many of this region's buildings such a distinctive and unique appearance. Next, we visit the Decembrist House museum which is dedicated to the memory of the exiled aristocrats who were forced to flee to this remote outpost after the failed revolution of 1825. Here we enjoy a private concert before returning to our waiting train for dinner.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 8</h4>
<h5>Lake Baikal</h5>
<p>Few natural sights can surpass the beauty and grandeur of Lake Baikal. For five hours we wind our way through tunnels along cliff hugging tracks above the lake with a vista of snow capped peaks along the far shore forming a picture-perfect backdrop. Lake Baikal is the deepest lake in the world and holds 20% of the world's freshwater. Also known as the 'Pearl of Siberia' it is home to a unique breed of freshwater seal and over fifty species of fish including omul which we will be serving in the dining car for some of our meals. Weather permitting, we stop at one of Baikal's picturesque and secluded bays to enjoy a delicious BBQ including freshly smoked fish prepared by our own chefs. For the brave hearted, there is even time for a refreshing swim in the crystal clear waters. In the afternoon, we visit Listvyanka, a small Baikal settlement nestling at the base of the surrounding hills. Tonight we return to Irkutsk and stay at the Marriot Courtyard Hotel (or similar) for your final evening.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 9</h4>
<h5>Irkutsk</h5>
<p>Following breakfast, you will be transferred to the airport to begin your journey home.</p>

Rhinos can be seen with calves at heel. Eland and waterbuck appear not to notice the human visitors, enabling photographers to shoot at ease. On the lake in the middle of the crater you may see thousands of flamingos, fluttering and shimmering like a pink heat haze.

<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 13 Days</p>
<p>Almaty, Tashkent, Samarkand, Bukhara, Merv, Ashgabat, Khiva, Kara Kum, Volgograd, Moscow</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>ALMATY</h5>
<p>Flights are met at Almaty Airport and guests are transferred to the centrally located five-star Inter-Continental Hotel for a one-night stay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>ALMATY, KAZAKHSTAN</h5>
<p>The city is set to play host to the 2011 Asian Winter Games after a failed bid to win the Winter Olympics is 2014.
Beautifully set in a valley in the foothills of the Tien Shen Mountains, we have lunch in a traditional Kazak 'yurt', a traditional dwelling place of the nomadic people of this region. Following our tour of Almaty, we will board the Golden Eagle this evening, and after settling into our cabins, we will enjoy our first dinner onboard.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>TASHKENT, UZBEKISTAN</h5>
<p>Today we spend a relaxing morning on board the train, socialising or maybe taking in one of the lectures and lessons on offer to give us a greater insight into this fascinating region. After lunch we arrive in the capital city of Uzbekistan and spend the afternoon touring this pleasant, modern, Soviet-style city, which was rebuilt after a devastating earthquake levelled it in 1966. After visiting the Museum of Fine Arts we have dinner on the train as it departs for Samarkand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>SAMARKAND</h5>
<p>Many words have been used to describe this jewel of the Islamic world, 'the Paris of the Muslim World' and 'Rome of the East'. Its admirers includes; Marco Polo, Tamerlane and Alexander the Great. Founded in the 6th century BC, its architecture gives an indication of its former status as one of the most important cities in Asia. We spend the day visiting the many fabulous buildings including the Bibi Kharum Mosque, the Ulag Beg observatory and the awe-inspiring Registan Square. Dinner is near the illuminated Registan Square, after which we return to the train for a late evening departure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>BUKHARA</h5>
<p>Traversing the Kyzyikum desert during the night we awake to the splendour of Uzbekistan's largest oasis city, Bukhara. Smaller than other cities in the country, it is perhaps just as, if not more, impressive as the larger Samarkand. Like Khiva UNESCO funded the renovation of much of the city for its 2,500th anniversary in 1999.
The highlight of our tour includes a visit to The Ark, the fortified residence of the Emirs of Bukhara, rulers infamous for their cruelty, and who survived into Soviet times. Lunch is within one of the city's many medressehs (beautifully-tiled Islamic schools). We then travel out of the city to visit the Emir's Palace of the Moon and Stars.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>MERV</h5>
<p>We arrive into Mary in the morning and transfer by bus to the ancient city of Merv. Once an important stop on the Silk Road, it is claimed that Merv was briefly the largest city in the world in the twelfth century before Merv was left to 'die' in 1794 after the Emir of Bukhara destroyed the dam which the population depended upon for water. On our tour we visit at least one of the five walled cities contained within the 50-square mile area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>ASHGABAT, TURKMENISTAN</h5>
<p>We arrive in the 'Las Vegas of the Kara Kum', the capital city of Turkmenistan, Ashgabat. A huge modern folly in the desert land which is a monument to the recently deceased President Sapamurat Turkmenbashi. Situated between the Kara Kum Desert and the Kopet Dag mountain range the scenery that forms the backdrop to the city is one of extremes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 8</h4>
<h5>KHIVA, UZBEKISTAN</h5>
<p>We cross back into Uzbekistan for our afternoon arrival in Urgench and transfer to this 2,500-year old city. Khiva was once one of the most important trading centres at the crossroads of the routes between Mongolia, Russia, China and Persia. Its former wealth is evident in the fabulous buildings, mosques, bazaars and minarets that are within the walled city and which have been restored with the support of UNESCO since 1991 for the city's 2,500th anniversary celebrations. Lunch is in the city and dinner on board the train.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 9</h4>
<h5>KARA KUM, KAZAKHSTAN</h5>
<p>We enjoy a relaxing day on board the Golden Eagle as we head through Kazakhstan's Kara Kum desert. As well as enjoying the scenery and the remote villages we briefly stop at from time to time there is also chance to relax in the bar car, chat to fellow passengers and maybe have a Russian language lesson.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 10</h4>
<h5>VOLGOGRAD, RUSSIA</h5>
<p>Situated on the banks of the Volga River, Stalingrad (as the city was known in Soviet times) was the scene of probably the most important battles in World War II. The Russians finally turned back the Nazi advance to the Caucasian oil fields in Baku at this city and turned the course of the Second World War. We visit the sobering Mamayev Kurgan war memorial, followed by the excellent diorama and museum. Tonight is our final evening on board the Golden Eagle and we mark the occasion with a farewell banquet.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 11</h4>
<h5>MOSCOW</h5>
<p>We arrive into Moscow late afternoon and transfer to the five-star Marriott Royal Aurora Hotel in the heart of the city for a two night stay.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 12</h4>
<h5>MOSCOW - FREEDOM OF CHOICE TOURING</h5>
<p>Our city tour of Moscow, principally takes us to Red Square, an iconic symbol of Russia's former military and political might. Here we see an eclectic mix of fascinating architecture, such as the ornate St. Basil's Cathedral with its magnificent onion-domed spires, the grandeur of The Kremlin and the sombre and evocative site of Lenin's tomb. With our Freedom of Choice touring options you may instead wish to visit, for example, the Tretyakov Gallery (National Museum of Russian Fine Art). At the conclusion of our city tour, our final evening is spent saying our goodbyes to our fellow travelling companions at the Farewell Dinner.

</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 13</h4>
<h5>MOSCOW</h5>
<p>Following breakfast in the hotel, you will be transferred to Moscow airport to begin your journey home.

Alternatively, we will offer a visit to the Han Yangling Museum. This tomb dating back 2,000 years with its adjoining museum is one of China's finest undiscovered secrets. Early evening we head back to the city for dinner and the excellent Tang Dynasty show.</p>

<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>Lanzhou</h5>
<p>A morning arrival into Lanzhou; a vital city on the Silk Route due to its principal crossing point of the mighty Yellow River. A visit to the Gansu Provincial Museum here provides evidence of the kind of goods that moved in an Eastward direction along the Silk Route and the famous 'galloping horse' dating from the Eastern Han period that was found in a nearby tomb. A late afternoon departure is followed by dinner this evening onboard the train.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>Dunhuang</h5>
<p>We arrive in the small oasis city of Dunhuang to visit the fascinating Magao Thousand Buddha Cave Complex. Containing almost 500 grottoes, carved between 700 and 1,700 years ago, they are filled with an amazing collection of sculptures and murals depicting the evolution of Buddhist religious art over a 1,000-year period. Over 2,000 statues and 45,000 murals still remain. We have lunch with a local folk performance in this magical setting. In the afternoon we take a camel ride to one of the natural wonders of the Gobi Desert, Crescent Lake, which has been a source of water among the incredible sand dunes for thousands of years.</p>

<h4>Day 9</h4>
<h5>Crossing to Kazakhstan</h5>
<p>After a final breakfast onboard the Chinese train, we pass through the dramatic mountain scenery of Druzhba before arriving in Alashankou, where border controls are carried out.

<li>
<h4>Day 12</h4>
<h5>Samarkand</h5>
<p>Many words have been used to describe this jewel of the Islamic world, 'the Paris of the Muslim World' and 'Rome of the East'. Its admirers includes; Marco Polo, Tamerlane and Alexander the Great. Founded in the 6th century BC, its architecture gives an indication of its former status as one of the most important cities in Asia. We spend the day visiting the many fabulous buildings including the Bibi Kharum Mosque, the Ulag Beg observatory and the awe-inspiring Registan Square. Dinner is near the illuminated Registan Square, after which we return to the train for a late evening departure.</p>

<h4>Day 13</h4>
<h5>Bukhara</h5>
<p>Traversing the Kyzyikum desert during the night we awake to the splendour of Uzbekistan's largest oasis city, Bukhara. Smaller than other cities in the country, it is perhaps just as, if not more, impressive as the larger Samarkand. Like Khiva UNESCO funded the renovation of much of the city for its 2,500th anniversary in 1999. The highlight of our tour includes a visit to The Ark, the fortified residence of the Emirs of Bukhara, rulers infamous for their cruelty, and who survived into Soviet times. Lunch is within one of the city's many medressehs (beautifully-tiled Islamic schools). We then travel out of the city to visit the Emir's Palace of the Moon and Stars.

<h4>Day 14</h4>
<h5>Merv</h5>

Once an important stop on the Silk Road, it is claimed that Merv was briefly the largest city in the world in the twelfth century before Merv was left to 'die' in 1794 after the Emir of Bukhara destroyed the dam which the population depended upon for water. On our tour we visit at least one of the five walled cities contained within the 50-square mile area.
</p>
</li>

<h4>Day 15</h4>
<h5>Ashgabat, Turkmenistan</h5>

A huge modern folly in the desert land which is a monument to the recently deceased President Sapamurat Turkmenbashi. Situated between the Kara Kum Desert and the Kopet Dag mountain range the scenery that forms the backdrop to the city is one of extremes.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 16</h4>
<h5>Khiva, Uzbekistan</h5>
<p>We cross back into Uzbekistan for our afternoon arrival in Urgench and transfer to this 2,500-year old city. Khiva was once one of the most important trading centres at the crossroads of the routes between Mongolia, Russia, China and Persia. Its former wealth is evident in the fabulous buildings, mosques, bazaars and minarets that are within the walled city and which have been restored with the support of UNESCO since 1991 for the city's 2,500th anniversary celebrations. Lunch is in the city and dinner on board the train.

<li>
<h4>Day 18</h4>
<h5>Volgograd, Russia</h5>
<p>Situated on the banks of the Volga River, Stalingrad (as the city was known in Soviet times) was the scene of probably the most important battles in World War II. The Russians finally turned back the Nazi advance to the Caucasian oil fields in Baku at this city and turned the course of the Second World War.

<li>
<h4>Day 20</h4>
<h5>Moscow with Freedom of Choice Touring</h5>

Here we see an eclectic mix of fascinating architecture, such as the ornate St. Basil's Cathedral with its magnificent onion-domed spires, the grandeur of The Kremlin and the sombre and evocative site of Lenin's  tomb.  With  our  Freedom  of  Choice  touring  options  you  may  instead  wish  to  visit,  for  example,  the Tretyakov Gallery (National Museum of Russian Fine Art).
