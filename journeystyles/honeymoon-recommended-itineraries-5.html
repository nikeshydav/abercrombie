<p>Buenos Aires is the birthplace of Tango, born in the brothels of the city, just before the beginning of the 1880s century. The word' Tango" refers to both a musical style and the dance performed to it. Tango, a dance known as passionate, sensual and very elegant, was all the rage in the 1930's in Buenos Aries and Paris. Tango is not only a dance but also an obsession. For the ´tanguero´, it is as much as a part of life as eating and sleeping. Erotic and passionate, haunting and melancholic, it involves not only the body but also the soul. Yes, it is just feeling - but in one dance, you can express sad, happy, angry, relax, deep, shallow, cheerful, sorrow, painful, serious, intellectual or just playful feelings. Tango has captured the popular imagination for over one hundred years to become no less than an international cult.</p>

Feel the pulse of this magical place as you visualize the lives of the priests, craftsmen, and servants who inhabited this seemingly uninhabitable citadel and then left, leaving no written records about its destruction. After a busy day of sightseeing, return to your beautiful mountainside retreat, high in the lush Andean clouds forest. It features the look and feel of a rural Andean village set in spectacular grounds with paths that wind past waterfalls and gardens, and trails that wander through wild forest. Snuggle under a thick alpaca blanket in your suite, which offers incredible views of the exotic gardens or the dramatic Vilcanota River.

<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 9 Nights</p>
<p>Relive the ambience of a bygone era on this journey through the riverine forests, expansive delta and spectacular game-filled bush land of Botswana. Romance is in the air - literally - when you sleep under the stars on an elevated platform and share a lantern-lit "star bath" on your private deck. The euphoria continues on a private sundowner cruise as you admire enjoy your beautiful surroundings and the array of wildlife that comes to the water's edge.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>	India/Johannesburg, South Africa</h5>
<p>On Arrival at Johannesburg, where you are met by an Abercrombie & Kent representative and taken to your hotel, set in one of the city's most exclusive residential suburbs amid lush hillside terraces and sculpted gardens. The balance of the day is at your leisure.
</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> The Westcliff Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan</strong> None
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Johannesburg/Maun, Botswana/Okavango Delta</h5>
<p>Fly to Maun and connect to your camp, located on the banks of the Boro River in the Okavango Delta. This labyrinth of waterways, wetlands and islands is an unspoiled paradise for some of Africa's greatest concentration of wildlife and birdlife. Your elegant African-themed suite is set on an elevated platform in the tree line, with a wooden deck that offers expansive views over the river and lagoon. Tonight, get close to nature - and each other - when you roll your bed onto the deck for the unique opportunity to sleep under the stars.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Sanctuary Baines' Camp <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5> Okavango Delta</h5>
<p>Game-viewing options flourish at Baines' Camp. Resting on 260,000 acres in a private concession neighboring the famed Moremi Game Reserve, the area is superb for viewing wildlife by land in open safari vehicles or on the water from a poled mokoro (dugout canoe). However, sometimes the best way to tune into the bush is on foot. Walking safaris are a specialty at your camp, and skilled guides introduce you to the area's natural wonders.

</p>
<p>
Return from a night game drive for a relaxing "star bath," a freestanding traditional Botswana-style zinc bathtub set out on your private deck, surrounded by lanterns.</p>
<p>Philanthropic Activities: During your time at Baines' you have the opportunity to participate in an educational experience with a group of semi-habituated African elephants. After a few safety tips from your mahout (trainer), you are encouraged to touch each of the elephants and lead one of them while it gently rests the tip of its trunk on your hand. You may even get a "kiss" on the cheek from one of your new friends. At a picnic spot under large shade trees, sit down and relax with cold refreshments and brunch. The elephants are fed pre-cut fodder, and you can observe them eating and playing together after their lunch.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Sanctuary Baines' Camp <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>Okavango Delta</h5>
<p>Fly to the Moremi Game Reserve and your camp, situated on the previous hunting grounds of the Batawana Tribe on Chief's Island. The camp overlooks the seasonal Piajio Channel within the Moremi Game Reserve, an area renowned for its abundant wildlife and large variety of bird life. Sanctuary Chief's Camp is made up of 12 luxury bush pavilions - each with a spacious seating area and game-viewing deck with a hammock. While you are here, take a dip in Chief's pool, pamper yourself in the spa and choose from a variety of activities that include game drives and mokoro safaris (in season).</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Sanctuary Baines' Camp <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day  5-6</h4>
<h5> Okavango Delta</h5>
<p>Game viewing in the Moremi is nothing short of spectacular. In addition to 400 species of birds, ostrich, antelope, crocodile, wildebeest, kudu and hippo are common here. However, the area has been dubbed the "predator capital" of Botswana, boasting leopard, cheetah, painted wild dog, spotted hyena and a large resident pride of lion. Game drives are conducted in custom-built open vehicles, offering an ideal viewing vantage point. While you are here, you may wish to take an optional helicopter excursion for a different perspective on the wildlife. A specially prepared romantic dinner is also in store for you during one of your evenings at Chief's.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Sanctuary Baines' Camp <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>Okavango Delta/Chobe National Park</h5>
<p>The name "Chilwero" means "place of high view" in the local Setswana language, and true to its namesake, Sanctuary Chobe Chilwero is positioned high above the Chobe River. Fly to Chobe National Park today and check in at your award-winning lodge, which offers unparalleled panoramic views across the islands and floodplains, stretching as far as Namibia. Your cottage features either a private garden or a sala (balcony) with a hammock, ideal for cuddling and casual game viewing.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Sanctuary Chobe Chilwero <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> Meals: B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 8</h4>
<h5>Chobe National Park</h5>
<p>Chobe National Park covers a diversity of landscapes, ranging from riverine forests to floodplains and periodic marshlands. The area is home to one of the largest concentration of elephants in Africa, as well as an abundance of lion, hippopotamus, buffalo, impala, puku, and a large variety of bird species. Embark on your first game drive shortly after sunrise. You can also view water-loving game up close from a different perspective when you board a small boat. End your day with a romantic couple's spa treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Sanctuary Chobe Chilwero  <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 9</h4>
<h5>Chobe National Park/Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe</h5>
<p>Travel overland this morning, crossing the border into Zimbabwe toward breathtaking Victoria Falls and your accommodations at the world-famous Victoria Falls Hotel. Built in 1904, the Victoria Falls Hotel's gracious colonial style epitomizes the romance of grand travel. Late this afternoon, set out on a private cruise on the Zambezi River aboard Ra-Ikane, a small luxury boat that reflects the ambience of a bygone era. Glide lazily down the river looking for hippo, elephant or buffalo coming to drink at the water's edge and absorb the stillness of the African bush as sunset brings the day to a close.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> The Victoria Falls Hotel <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 10</h4>
<h5>Victoria Falls/Johannesburg/Depart</h5>
<p>The final day of your adventure begins with an exclusive "Flight of Angels" that offers the amazing opportunity to travel above the majestic falls in a helicopter for unrivaled views of the crashing waters. When you are back on the ground, set out on a walking tour of Victoria Falls. Notice the permanent rainbows that crisscross the gorge, producing images that are more like paintings than reality. The unique tropical rainforest that veils the edge of the falls, the rising spray and thundering roar as these waters break against the ragged rocks below make a sight and sound never to be forgotten. Later, transfer to the airport and fly to Johannesburg for your homebound flight.</p>
<p><strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>

Rhinos can be seen with calves at heel. Eland and waterbuck appear not to notice the human visitors, enabling photographers to shoot at ease. On the lake in the middle of the crater you may see thousands of flamingos, fluttering and shimmering like a pink heat haze.
