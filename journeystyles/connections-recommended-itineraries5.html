Hugging the Atlantic coast road we journey past the bikini beaches of Clifton, Camps Bay and Llandudno, beautifully located at the base of the towering Twelve Apostles Mountains. We travel over the Suikerbossie (Sugar Bush) Pass and descend into the bucolic Hout Bay valley, with its bustling fishing harbour, white sand beach and picturesque village.<br /></p><p align=justify>In Hout Bay we will cruise the waters to Seal Island, home to the Cape Fur Seal. It is a wondrous show to behold - a water ballet by a thousand seals, pirouetting, diving and surfacing to a symphony of gull cries, timpani courtesy of the South Atlantic swell gently keeping time against the ancient granite shore. If you want to see a special part of the Peninsula from another perspective, this is about as good as it gets.</p><p align=justify>We travel over the famous Chapman's Peak Drive (subject to road conditions) to join the sea again at the town of Noordhoek. This historic road, high on the mountainside overlooking the sea, was once considered impossible to build, but Charl Marais (mining surveyor) rose to the challenge and Chapman's Peak Drive was opened to the public in 1922. Our journey continues to the Cape of Good Hope Nature Reserve at the end of the Cape Peninsula.</p><p align=justify>The reserve, which covers 22000 acres of land, converges in the south at Cape Point, a great pinnacle of rock. You can climb the steps or ride a funicular railway - the Flying Dutchman - to the top from where you may see southern right whales in spring and early summer, dolphins and a variety of seabirds. The original lighthouse at Cape Point was built in 1860.</p><p align=justify>The present lighthouse, one of the most powerful in the southern hemisphere, is closer to the point itself than the original. An alternative option (for the more energetic) is to take a scenic cliff-top trail to the Cape of Good Hope itself, the most south-westerly point in Africa, where your guide and vehicle would meet you. Afterwards we travel back through the reserve looking out for some of the animals that live here, including the rare Bontebok, Eland, Cape Mountain Zebra and Ostrich.</p><p align=justify>En route to lunch we visit Boulders, a lovely beach sheltered from the wind and famous for its colony of endangered Jackass Penguins on the coast of False Bay near Simon's Town. Boulders, had just two breeding pairs in 1982, but thanks to careful management the population has grown to about 3000 in recent years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p align=justify>Pass through Simon's Town, which was the Royal Navy's main base in the south Atlantic from 1815 until 1957 and has the feel of a small English seaside village with steep narrow streets and cobbled alleyways. You will learn about the famous hound called Just Nuisance, the most renowned animal in the annals of the Royal Navy. We continue to Kalk Bay the quaint fishing hamlet on the False Bay coast with a protected little harbour of brightly painted wooden boats.</p><p align=justify>The narrow main street is renowned for antique and art shops which make fascinating browsing. We lunch in Kalk Bay before journeying back into Cape Town via Boyes Drive for wonderful views of the harbour. We emerge above Muizenberg a famous location in South African history as it was the site of the Battle of Muizenberg in 1795 when British forces invaded the Cape and defeated the Dutch colonists.</p><p align=justify>We travel back towards Cape Town passing through the attractive, up-market suburb of Constantia, the cradle of the South African wine industry boasting famous estates like Klein Constantia. We continue to Streetwires passing interesting sites such as the University of Cape Town, Rhodes Memorial and Mostert's Mill, a Dutch windmill dating back to 1797 and still in working order.&nbsp;</p><p align=justify>Thereafter we return to the hotel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";

This World Heritage Site is one of the places where man is believed to have originated.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You will visit the private, working site of Drimolen which was only discovered in 1992 and is already the third richest hominid site in Southern Africa. Access to this site is by arrangement only. On 26 April 2000, the discovery of the most complete female Australopithecus robustus skull along with a complete male jaw which made world headlines.&nbsp;</p><p>This site has unearthed 79 hominid fossils, a wealth of faunal remains and some fossil Homo babies. As the site is being excavated all year round, it provides an excellent opportunity to see an excavation in progress. On arrival at Drimolen, you will be served tea, coffee and refreshments at a secluded picnic site while a short fossil cast demonstration and talk on human evolution is presented by a scientist.&nbsp;</p><p>This will be followed by a guided tour of the actual fossilferous deposit of Drimolen where fossils at least 1.2 million years old may be viewed. A light, catered picnic lunch will be provided under the trees, before heading back to Johannesburg for a guided visit of the South African Museum of Rock Art at the Origins Centre. This world-class facility was recently opened at the University of the Witwatersrand. The museum has an outstanding, and fascinating, collection of rock paintings, engravings and artifacts, but more importantly, the history of South Africa is told through the art of the San people. If we want to understand the culture, the spiritual beliefs, and the very essence of the Zulu and Xhosa people as they are today, and even the reasons for the development of Soweto and other townships - we need to take a step back a few hundred years, and follow the path that the rock art stories can tell us.&nbsp;</p><p>Originally San rock art was seen as just pictures of animals and people, and narrative accounts of the hunter-gatherer life. Only now have researchers discovered the spiritual meaning behind the rock art, and their importance. Rock paintings and engravings have proved a valuable tool for Nature Conservationists, as the San provided historical evidence of wildlife species that occurred in their area hundreds of years ago.</p><p>Return to your hotel in the late afternoon.</p>";

Built between 1666 and 1679 by the Dutch East India Company, this pentagonal fortification replaced a small clay and timber fort, built in 1652 by Commander Jan van Riebeeck, founder of the maritime replenishment station at the Cape of Good Hope.</p><p align=justify>The Castle Military Museum depicts the military history of the Cape, the Castle and Cape Regiments. Also worth a visit is the William Fehr collection consisting of artwork reflecting many aspects of cultural life at the Cape from the early VOC days until the middle of the 19th century. End your tour visiting the notorious dungeon. As a result of rising damp, the dungeon was not fit to store gun powder as intended and was later used as a prison for the accused awaiting trial.</p><p align=justify>At the Victoria &amp; Alfred Waterfront you visit the Two Ocean's Aquarium, where over 3000 living sea animals, including sharks, fishes, seals, turtles and penguins can be seen in this spectacular underwater nature reserve. Your tour will end at the hotel or at the bustling Victoria &amp; Alfred Waterfront, built around the old harbour. A hugely popular destination with tourists and locals alike (80% of visitors are from Cape Town itself) the Waterfront is unique in terms of being a working harbour while still boasting a varied selection of eclectic shops, restaurants and tourist attractions from scenic helicopter rides to boat cruises.</p><p align=justify>The remainder of the afternoon and evening is at leisure.</p>";

						description = description + "<p align=justify>Meet the guide this morning in the reception area of the hotel for a full day Family tour of the Winelands.</p><p align=justify>We leave Cape Town and head to Spier for the Cheetah experience. This morning enjoy a viewing of the Cheetah's, where a guide from the Outreach Programme will accompany you into the Cheetah enclosure where you will have the opportunity of stroking one of these magnificent creatures. The Cheetah Outreach assists the Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF) in their efforts to ensure the survival of the free-ranging cheetah.</p><p align=justify>This is done through education programmes that increase the awareness of the diminishing numbers of free-ranging cheetahs in the wild. Funds are raised for CCF to support their efforts in releasing trapped, wild cheetah and non-lethal predator control methods (i.e. placement of guard dogs in Namibian farmlands). Cheetah Outreach was founded by Annie Beckhelling in January 1997 on a hectare of land donated by Spier. The education programme began with two cheetahs: Inca (6-year old male) whose role was to greet visitors at Spier and Shadow (1-year old male) who travelled to community events.</p><p align=justify>At Spier, with an annual visitor-ship of 650,000 people, the cheetah ambassadors are able to greet more than 10% of the guests. Since our successful beginning, Cheetah Outreach quickly expanded with the arrival of three cubs in September 1997. Nyana-Spier, Charlie-Girl and Moya enjoyed the public attention. Moya was donated to the Angel Trust Fund (Cincinnati, Ohio) to assist them with their efforts of raising awareness for the plight of the cheetah.</p><p align=justify>Our facility is continually evolving and growing and we are taking on more challenges than ever before. We are actively involved in cub rearing and are partners with De Wildt. Cheetah Outreach Education department aims to facilitate the increased respect and pride for South Africa's indigenous fauna in the youth of previously disadvantaged communities; using the cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) as an ambassador species and to plant the seed of a conservation ethic. On the same property you will also view the Birds of Prey. Founded in December 2001 by Hank &amp; Tracy Chalmers, Eagle Encounters is a bird of prey rehabilitation, education, conservation and eco-tourism center. As a self-funded, non-profit establishment, we rely on the income generated by tourism to drive the numerous programmes.</p><p align=justify>Our long-term vision is to do our part in preserving the eco-environment by protecting birds of prey through the release of prime rehabilitatable candidates, and through creating community awareness. Eagle Encounters is not a zoo and our birds do not live in cages.</p><p align=justify>Take a stroll through our 'weathering area' where you can openly view the largest, smallest, strongest, fastest and cheekiest. After this experience we continue to Franschhoek and M&ocirc;reson. Mom and Dad will enjoy some of the finest wines of the Franschhoek valley while the kids will make their own bread in the Bread &amp; Wine Restaurant. M&ocirc;reson is one of the original farms granted to the French Huguenots in 1695 by Governor Simon van der Stel and is situated close to Franschhoek.</p><p align=justify>This little town with lots of ambiance, a fascinating history, breathtaking scenery with a definite French character, is also the culinary capital of South Africa.&nbsp;</p><p align=justify>When mom and dad have finished their wine tasting, they will go to the restaurant and join the children for lunch at the Bread &amp; Wine Restaurant. The restaurant is set among the lemon orchards and vineyards of the M&ocirc;reson wine estate in the famous Franschhoek valley of food and wine. Diners are satisfied and the desires of their taste buds are indulged in a playful affair of the senses.&nbsp;</p><p align=justify>After lunch, you will travel to the town of Franschhoek where you will visit Huguenot Chocolates. Huguenot Chocolates is a boutique chocolaterie which offers a delicious range of chocolates made from the finest imported Belgian chocolate. The programme includes chocolate tasting, demonstrations and a talk on the history of chocolate. The kids will have the opportunity to make their own chocolates to take home. After the chocolate tasting, the town of Franschhoek can be explored.&nbsp;</p><p align=justify>A visit of the Huguenot Memorial and Museum illustrate the life of the Huguenots at the Cape of Good Hope. From Franschhoek you will drive to Paarl where you will enjoy a scenic drive through this historical town returning to your hotel in Cape Town in the late afternoon.</p>";

The aim is to bridge the gap between the wild world of the Baboons and the civilised world of their human cousins.</p><p>The remaining Chacma Baboons on the southern peninsula (close to Cape Town), face a bleak future as continued urbanization reduces wilderness areas, resulting in on-going conflict situations between man and baboon. Due to the unacceptably high mortality rates it was predicted that within 15 years the baboons would face certain extinction. At the current mortality rate there will not be a viable baboon population on the peninsula within the next 10 years.</p><p>The Baboon Monitor Project was started in 1999 and over the past five years has considerably reduced the conflicts between primates by keeping baboons out of villages for 85% of days. The project employs 8 men from the nearby community of Masiphumelele. These men have been working closely with the baboons and have gained a wealth of wildlife experience as well as developing unique relationships with the baboons of the Da Gama and Slangkop troops. Funding for the Baboon Monitor Project is an on-going concern as pressing social issues dominate the current funding situation in South Africa.</p><p>To support this important conservation initiative, 25% of net proceeds from this walk will be utilized to ensure the continuation of the Baboon Monitor Project. By taking part in this excursion, you are showing your support for this important conservation initiative. You will be guided across the mountains around Cape Town to spend time with the last remaining Chacma Baboons in the Cape Peninsula. For 2-3 hours you will be walking through the mountain fynbos until you encounter the baboons in their home territory.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to sit and watch these fascinating animals as they eat, play and socialize around you. Qualified guides ensure your safety and enjoyment of this unique experience.</p><p>Return to the hotel in the afternoon and the remainder of the day is at leisure.</p>";
