<li>
 <h5>Detailed Itinerary</h5>   
    <h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>WELCOME TO CHILE!</h5>
<p>Upon your arrival at Santiago airport you will receive an exclusive meet & greet at the disembarking gate of your flight by your  A&K Representative. Your local A&K guide will immediately assist you with immigration and custom formalities.  </p>
<p>You will continue with your guide to explore some of the best Chile's wine valleys. Casablanca is one of the most emblematic valleys on Chile's wine circuit and provides an enticing mix of some of the country's finest whites like Loma Larga wines. We invite you to discover Loma Larga peaceful vineyard's area and its beautiful old parks before an exclusive wines tasting on the country-state house. Then you will continue to the San Antonio valley, Chile's newest and smallest D.O. and home to several new vineyards, such as Matetic vineyard.</p>
<p>The Matetic family owns the entire Rosario valley Estate, which has a luxurious but rustic-looking guesthouse at one end, an impressive, hi-tech bodega at the other. The family history starts in Punta Arenas, at the end of the 19th century, with the arrival to Chile of Jorge Matetic Cetinja. Armed with a tremendous spirit of adventure, this Croatian immigrant sailed from Europe to settle in the far southern part of America. This same spirit of adventure is what led the company into the wine-growing business in 1999, in the firm belief that climatic characteristics associated with the kind of soil and light in this part of the country could produce high quality wines. How correct they were. Due to its geographic location, its temperate coastal Mediterranean climate has a strong ocean influence, with significant thermal fluctuations during the day - 20 degrees in the ripening period. The temperature normally rises quickly during the morning, until noon, when a soft ocean breeze helps maintain an average 26 degrees during the summer, a temperature that is ideal for the ripening of grapes. </p>
<p>Enjoy a private wine tasting before an exquisite lunch on the winery's restaurant.<br />
The rest of the afternoon is at leisure to enjoy the beautiful garden of the vineyard. </p>
<p>A romantic dinner under the stars will be served at your lodge “La Casona of Vineyard Matetic”  </p>
<p><strong>Overnight: </strong> La Casona Vineyard Matetic<br />
<strong>Meal Plan: </strong> D </p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2 </h4>
<h5>SANTIAGO - SAN PEDRO DE ATACAMA</h5>
<p>Enjoy a lavish breakfast & later you will be assisted to connect with your flight to Calama, the gateway of your adventure in the Atacama Desert.</p>
<p>The quaint oasis town of San Pedro de Atacama sits in the driest desert in the world – Atacama – and is the main base for explorations in the area. This region was the principal center of the Atacamanian Indian culture, and relics such as Tulor, an ancient village estimated to have been built in 800 B.C., and the superb archaeology museum boasts hundreds of artifacts that have been well preserved by the desert's arid climate. But it is perhaps San Pedro's intangible magic that captivates its visitors in the end. San Pedro's streets have a pleasant, artistic, bohemian vibe, and its adobe buildings maintain a certain charm and unique character.</p>
<p>Upon arrival at the local airport of “El Loa” in the city of Calama, you will be welcomed by your local guide from Awasi lodge, for one hour transfer to where your lodge is located. </p>
<p><strong>Awasi Lodge</strong><br />Each cottage of this small hotel is tastefully appointed, with generous spaces, private patio, a reading area, as well as indoor and outdoor showers. What really sets Awasi apart from the competition is the fact that for each cottage there will be a guide and 4x4 vehicle; making for the most personalized experience for guests. The aim of Awasi is simple; provide a luxurious environment from which one can admire the immensity of the Atacama Desert, while enjoying life's creature comforts.</p>
<p>Upon arrival at the hotel, you will enjoy your lunch at the lodge and your guide will be ready to explain you the different activities available for this afternoon. </p>
<p>In the evening return to the hotel for a private candle light dinner, follow by a stargazing tour at one of the clearest sky in the world. The special light conditions, crystal clear atmosphere and aridness of the Atacama Desert make it one of the finest places in the world for astronomical observation. This has led to the installation of important astronomical observatories in the area in the past few years such as the ALMA Project, which will be the world’s largest radio telescope. With the help of an expert, you will learn the basic concepts and history of astronomy. You will discover the ancestral Andean culture’s interpretation of the universe and the constellations, how they measured it and the legends they created around it. You will also learn the difference between traditional astronomy and radio astronomy, the objectives of the ALMA</p>

        <h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>SAN PEDRO DE ATACAMA</h5>
<p>You will have two days at leisure at Awasi lodge to enjoy any of the daily activities available to explore the Atacama Desert. Some of the highly recommended activities for the day would be:</p>
<p>A visit to the ethereal Moon Valley<br />
Leave Awasi and head to the Natural Reserve, which is located some 15 minutes away in the middle of the Salt Range. Its name speaks of the magic of the landscape. As the tour progresses, you find lookouts from which to observe the unusual geological shapes which, together with the action of wind and water, have originated a land relief reminiscent of the inhospitable beauty of the lunar surface. The final moments of the sunset when, in a matter of seconds, luminous streaks bring out subtle coloring differences in the mountains, is simply indescribable.</p>
<p>Highland Salt Lakes<br />
Highly recommendable, as there are few places in the highlands which offer such a variety! Leave Awasi heading south and visit the towns of Toconao and Socaire situated at 10.600 ft. (so a level of prior adaptation to the altitude would be required). Along the way you will find different types of landscapes, which run from the driest dessert to small oases and mountain views. You will be able to see vicunas, among other wild species. You will be surprised by the immensity and inhospitable beauty of the Tuyajtu and Aguas Calientes salt lakes, with their turquoise colored ponds inhabited by ducks and flamingoes.</p>

Enjoy the place and the peculiarity of its fumaroles; before returning to Awasi, stop at the Puritama warm springs, where you can bathe and enjoy an appetizer.</p>
<p>On your way back, enjoy another exciting experience - surfing in the dunes of San Pedro de Atacama. Sand board is a great experience not just because of the place, but also due to the strong feeling that you will get when you are going down in a dunes of 120 metres!!</p>

The factory was in operation for 70 years, generating work and contributing to the development of the region. After a long period of neglect, the building was restored to its former industrial grandeur and as a result of the meticulous conservation, was declared a National Monument in 1996.</p>

    <h5>Extension option:</h5>
    <strong>4 DAYS EASTER ISLAND</strong>
<h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>SANTIAGO / EASTER ISLAND </h5>
<p>Depart Santiago this morning to board your flight to Easter Island.</p>
<p>Discovered on Easter Sunday in 1722 (hence the name), Easter Island is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the most isolated place on the face of the Earth! Located at a distance of 3,700 km from the nearest populated point (which is the Chilean mainland; although more Polynesian than South American in character); the 64-square mile island is now famous as the world’s largest ‘open air Museum’ on account of the Moai, or human-like stone statues, (more than 600 of them), that can be found on the island. The Moai remain very much a mystery which archaeologists are still trying to unlock by interpreting an ancient language of the Rapa Nui that holds the key to understanding this culture, and is written on the so called ‘rongo rongo tablets’.  </p>
<p>The island owes its origin to three volcanoes which erupted some three million years ago: Poike, Rano Kau and Maunga Terevaka. In addition to the cultural and archaeological interest, there are the beautiful beaches, transparent waters and coral reefs that might be expected of a Pacific Island and Jacques Cousteau himself agreed that it is one of the most perfect places for under-water marine studies. </p>
<p>Upon arrival to the local airport Mataveri, you will be welcomed with traditional floral collars and transfer to Explora Lodge, Posada Mike Rapu. </p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Explora Lodge, Posada Mike Rapu.<br />
<strong>Meal Plan: </strong> B, D </p>

  <h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5> EASTER ISLAND </h5>  
<p>Your next two days will be completely at leisure for you to explore the island as you wish. There are several options and every evening your guide will meet you in the bar/living room area of the hotel. Your guide will explain to you the excursions available for the next day and help you choose the best exploration for you according to your interests and abilities. There are treks, bicycle rides, and explorations in the ocean (snorkeling, fishing using traditional methods, and boat trips), enabling you to gain an in-depth understanding of the culture and geography of Rapa Nui, its ancestral, megalithic figures, the Moai, and the special idiosyncrasies of its people. </p>
<p>This afternoon we recommend you try the ‘Motus’ (Islet Boat Ride)<br />
Your private chauffer will drive you from Hotel Posada de Mike Rapu to Hanga Roa Otai or Hanga Piko. From there, you depart by traditional Rapa Nui fishing boats. Ride out to view formations of coastal caves and the cliffs of Rano Kau, as well as the south side motus—well known for the Birdman Competition.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Explora Lodge, Posada Mike Rapu.<br />
<strong>Meal Plan: </strong>B </p>
</li>
<li>
   <h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5> EASTER ISLAND </h5>  
<p>This morning we highly recommend you indulge in some snorkeling!!</p>
<p>The waters off the coast of the island are known for being some of the most transparent in the world. Travel by your private boat to one of the designated areas best suited for snorkeling. With equipment provided by the hotel and accompanied by your guide, discover the beautiful waters where one can see a variety of endemic aquatic fauna including corals, mollusks, crustaceans, and tropical fish.  </p>
<p>Later this afternoon, make your way to one of the most stunning white sand beached of the area – it is a hidden gem called Ovahe. This beautiful and desolate beach is surrounded by breathtaking cliffs. Once you make your way down to the beach, your lunch will be laid out for you & you would be left alone to enjoy the spectacular setting.</p>
<p>End your day with a sundowner on your private boat while making your way back to the Lodge.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, fly to Florianopolis. Upon arrival at Florianopolis airport, you will be met by your guide who will take you to paradise. The destination is "Ganchos". That's how it was baptized by its founders: Azorean immigrants who settled on this lush, mountainous, cove-studded peninsula, more than two hundred years ago at the height of the whaling boom. Some decades ago, the small city was renamed as Governador Celso Ramos. Protected from people's curiosity as by its topography, Ganchos has to this day remained one of the last surviving secrets of the Brazilian coast.</p>
<p>More than just natural beauty, a whole way of life has been preserved here. The colonist’s descendants still make their living from the sea – nowadays cultivating oysters, scallops and other shellfish.</p>
<p>You leave the main road behind and eight miles further on you find yourself winding along through a succession of villages strung along the north-facing peninsula as though frozen in time. Slow down. The coast road passes hard by the picturesque colonial style houses, as calm little bays come into view one by one, the water dotted with the simple boats and mollusk farmers colored buoys.</p>
<p>At the end of an unassuming lane, a gate will open to reveal the most amazing spot on the whole peninsula.</p>
<p>Welcome to Ponta dos Ganchos.</p>
<p>Be warned in advance: it’s not easy to leave the bungalow. Well, of course, the instant you call for one, an electric car will appear at your door in a flash. Nevertheless, sometimes it is going to be difficult to want to leave. It might be because of the therapeutic mattress or perhaps, it is because there are just too many threads in the Egyptian cotton sheets! </p>
<p>Other times it will be a combination of things – your private wine cellar will join forces with the view of the sunset over the bay to prevent you from venturing beyond the terrace. This is the reason why breakfast is like a miniature gourmet festival – a parade of delicacies served in dainty portions. Providing a little competition for the terrace of your bungalow is a little stone island just in front of the beach that you can reach swimming or along a catwalk.</p>
<p>This evening a special tent will be pitched for you by the sea side to be able to enjoy a private couple’s massage, followed by sundowners. Dinner will be catered for you in the privacy of your room, enabling you to soak in the stunning ambience & each other’s company!</p>

<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>PONTA DOS GANCHOS</h5>
<p>Day at leisure<br>
Once you've become accustomed to the idea that the bungalows, with its creature comforts and its view, is always going to be there waiting for you, you will become more enthusiastic about venturing out. There is a wide selection of short trips, lasting from a couple of hours to a whole afternoon and that don’t involve leaving the peninsula; or going too far away from your whirlpool bath.</p>
<p>A quick chat with the concierge will provide you with enough activity choices to keep you busy for this visit such as: visit to oyster farm, a walk along deserted beaches, a visit to the dolphins, beaches and forest on horseback, trip to waterfall by bike, diving with biodiversity, sport fishing and more.</p>

<p>No visit to Buenos Aires is complete without dinner and a tango show! We would recommend the one at Esquina Carlos Gardel.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires is the birthplace of Tango, born in the brothels of the city, just before the beginning of the 1880s century. The word “Tango” refers to both a musical style and the dance performed to it. Tango, a dance known as passionate, sensual and very elegant, was all the rage in the 1930's in Buenos Aries and Paris. Tango is not only a dance but also an obsession. For the ´tanguero´, it is as much as a part of life as eating and sleeping. Erotic and passionate, haunting and melancholic, it involves not only the body but also the soul. Yes, it is just feeling - but in one dance, you can express sad, happy, and angry, relax, deep, shallow, cheerful, sorrow, painful, serious, intellectual or just playful feelings. Tango has captured the popular imagination for over one hundred years to become no less than an international cult.</p>

Constructed of rose-colored granite, this huge installation was once a thriving complex of baths, temples and military barracks. Below the fortress lies a complete Incan town, also called Ollantaytambo, still inhabited and with its original architecture and layout preserved.</p>

Built in 1535 by the illustrious Spanish conquistador Jerónimo de Aliaga, co-founder of Lima and of the oldest university in the Americas, this incredible relic of colonial splendor has been home to 17 generations of his descendants ever since. Located in Lima’s central Jirón de la Unión, just half a block from the beautiful Plaza de Armas, centuries of restoration undertaken by the countless generations of Aliagas have given the house its own particular physiognomy that you will be able to appreciate today as you visit with your private guide.</p>
