<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 9 Nights</p>
<p>Relive the ambience of a bygone era on this journey through the riverine forests, expansive delta and spectacular game-filled bush land of Botswana. Romance is in the air - literally - when you sleep under the stars on an elevated platform and share a lantern-lit "star bath" on your private deck. The euphoria continues on a private sundowner cruise as you admire enjoy your beautiful surroundings and the array of wildlife that comes to the water's edge.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>	India/Johannesburg, South Africa</h5>
<p>On Arrival at Johannesburg, where you are met by an Abercrombie & Kent representative and taken to your hotel, set in one of the city's most exclusive residential suburbs amid lush hillside terraces and sculpted gardens. The balance of the day is at your leisure.
</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> The Westcliff Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan</strong> None
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Johannesburg/Maun, Botswana/Okavango Delta</h5>
<p>Fly to Maun and connect to your camp, located on the banks of the Boro River in the Okavango Delta. This labyrinth of waterways, wetlands and islands is an unspoiled paradise for some of Africa's greatest concentration of wildlife and birdlife. Your elegant African-themed suite is set on an elevated platform in the tree line, with a wooden deck that offers expansive views over the river and lagoon. Tonight, get close to nature - and each other - when you roll your bed onto the deck for the unique opportunity to sleep under the stars.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Sanctuary Baines' Camp <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5> Okavango Delta</h5>
<p>Game-viewing options flourish at Baines' Camp. Resting on 260,000 acres in a private concession neighboring the famed Moremi Game Reserve, the area is superb for viewing wildlife by land in open safari vehicles or on the water from a poled mokoro (dugout canoe). However, sometimes the best way to tune into the bush is on foot. Walking safaris are a specialty at your camp, and skilled guides introduce you to the area's natural wonders.

</p>
<p>
Return from a night game drive for a relaxing "star bath," a freestanding traditional Botswana-style zinc bathtub set out on your private deck, surrounded by lanterns.</p>
<p>Philanthropic Activities: During your time at Baines' you have the opportunity to participate in an educational experience with a group of semi-habituated African elephants. After a few safety tips from your mahout (trainer), you are encouraged to touch each of the elephants and lead one of them while it gently rests the tip of its trunk on your hand. You may even get a "kiss" on the cheek from one of your new friends. At a picnic spot under large shade trees, sit down and relax with cold refreshments and brunch. The elephants are fed pre-cut fodder, and you can observe them eating and playing together after their lunch.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Sanctuary Baines' Camp <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>Okavango Delta</h5>
<p>Fly to the Moremi Game Reserve and your camp, situated on the previous hunting grounds of the Batawana Tribe on Chief's Island. The camp overlooks the seasonal Piajio Channel within the Moremi Game Reserve, an area renowned for its abundant wildlife and large variety of bird life. Sanctuary Chief's Camp is made up of 12 luxury bush pavilions - each with a spacious seating area and game-viewing deck with a hammock. While you are here, take a dip in Chief's pool, pamper yourself in the spa and choose from a variety of activities that include game drives and mokoro safaris (in season).</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Sanctuary Baines' Camp <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day  5-6</h4>
<h5> Okavango Delta</h5>
<p>Game viewing in the Moremi is nothing short of spectacular. In addition to 400 species of birds, ostrich, antelope, crocodile, wildebeest, kudu and hippo are common here. However, the area has been dubbed the "predator capital" of Botswana, boasting leopard, cheetah, painted wild dog, spotted hyena and a large resident pride of lion. Game drives are conducted in custom-built open vehicles, offering an ideal viewing vantage point. While you are here, you may wish to take an optional helicopter excursion for a different perspective on the wildlife. A specially prepared romantic dinner is also in store for you during one of your evenings at Chief's.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Sanctuary Baines' Camp <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>Okavango Delta/Chobe National Park</h5>
<p>The name "Chilwero" means "place of high view" in the local Setswana language, and true to its namesake, Sanctuary Chobe Chilwero is positioned high above the Chobe River. Fly to Chobe National Park today and check in at your award-winning lodge, which offers unparalleled panoramic views across the islands and floodplains, stretching as far as Namibia. Your cottage features either a private garden or a sala (balcony) with a hammock, ideal for cuddling and casual game viewing.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Sanctuary Chobe Chilwero <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> Meals: B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 8</h4>
<h5>Chobe National Park</h5>
<p>Chobe National Park covers a diversity of landscapes, ranging from riverine forests to floodplains and periodic marshlands. The area is home to one of the largest concentration of elephants in Africa, as well as an abundance of lion, hippopotamus, buffalo, impala, puku, and a large variety of bird species. Embark on your first game drive shortly after sunrise. You can also view water-loving game up close from a different perspective when you board a small boat. End your day with a romantic couple's spa treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Sanctuary Chobe Chilwero  <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 9</h4>
<h5>Chobe National Park/Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe</h5>
<p>Travel overland this morning, crossing the border into Zimbabwe toward breathtaking Victoria Falls and your accommodations at the world-famous Victoria Falls Hotel. Built in 1904, the Victoria Falls Hotel's gracious colonial style epitomizes the romance of grand travel. Late this afternoon, set out on a private cruise on the Zambezi River aboard Ra-Ikane, a small luxury boat that reflects the ambience of a bygone era. Glide lazily down the river looking for hippo, elephant or buffalo coming to drink at the water's edge and absorb the stillness of the African bush as sunset brings the day to a close.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> The Victoria Falls Hotel <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 10</h4>
<h5>Victoria Falls/Johannesburg/Depart</h5>
<p>The final day of your adventure begins with an exclusive "Flight of Angels" that offers the amazing opportunity to travel above the majestic falls in a helicopter for unrivaled views of the crashing waters. When you are back on the ground, set out on a walking tour of Victoria Falls. Notice the permanent rainbows that crisscross the gorge, producing images that are more like paintings than reality. The unique tropical rainforest that veils the edge of the falls, the rising spray and thundering roar as these waters break against the ragged rocks below make a sight and sound never to be forgotten. Later, transfer to the airport and fly to Johannesburg for your homebound flight.</p>

<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 8 Days</p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong>Siem Reap - Song Saa Island offers famous of Angkor and the less known Beng Mealea, Exploring the Tonle Sap lake, known as the Great Lake or sea of fresh water & Relax at beautiful beach Sang saa Island.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>Arrival Siem Reap </h5>
<p>Upon arrival you will be met by an A&K Representative with A&K Signage and your name in the restricted area. He will assist you with <strong>VISA ON ARRIVAL</strong> application rapid transit through immigration to collect your checked luggage and custom clearance. A&K representative will complete all necessary forms on your behalf.</p>
<p>After clearing all entrance formalities, met and greeted by your local English speaking guide and thereafter transferred by a private vehicle to your deluxe hotel for check-in. The transfer time is approximately 20 minutes.</p>
<p>"Nestled between rice paddies and stretched along a river, this former sleepy riverside provincial town of Siem Reap serves as the gateway to the ancient magnificent Angkor and other ruins which formerly the seat of power for the once vast and glorious Khmer empire through the 9th and 15th centuries AD. With a distinct colonial and Chinese style of architecture this town emanated from a cluster of old villages, but today is alive with culture, restaurants and pubs. Siem Reap is the hub for the Angkor Archaeological Park, Designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, which encompasses dozens of temple ruins including the legendary Angkor Wat whose archaeological significance  and visual impact sets it amongst other wonders of the world, such as the Pyramids, Machu Pichu and the Taj Mahal."</p>
<p>Balance of the day is free at your own leisure.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight Stay:</strong>	Amansara Resort
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5> Siem Reap// Visit Angkor Thom,  Bayon Temple & Tonle Sap Lake </h5>
<p>Breakfast at the hotel</p>
<p>Begin your touring this morning at <strong>Angkor Thom</strong>, the heavily fortified city built in the 10th century by the greatest of the Khmer rulers, King Jayavarman VII (1181 - 1201). With a population in excess of one million inhabitants, Angkor Thom covered an area of 10 square kilometres and was larger than any city in Europe at the time. </p>
<p>From Angkor Thom's southern gateway, continue to visit the <strong>Bayon Temple</strong>. The structure is staggering in its construction and most Angkor specialists agree that it is one of the finest examples of classic Khmer architecture. Its third level is stunning; its 49 towers are adorned with 172 smiling faces of the omnipresent Avalokitesvara. Constructed during the reign of King Jayavarman VII, this temple marks the exact centre of Angkor Thom, thus it is the most venerated of the city's temples and also the most mysterious. Set off on an elephant back riding around Bayon temple before exploring the mega building led by your expert guide.</p>
<p>Leaving the Bayon take a brief stop at the Royal Enclosures to see the <strong>Elephant Terrace</strong>, the terrace takes its name from the exceptional depiction of elephants and of an elephant hunt, which takes up the majority of the frieze. A little north of the main terrace is another, known as the <strong>Terrace of the Leper King</strong> after a statue found above it.</p>
<p>The remaining of the morning, you will be visiting a unique jungle temple which is captivated by the large trees and vines that have grown over it. <strong>Ta Prohm</strong> was built by King Jayavarman VII (1181-1219) as a Mahayana Buddhist monastery and university. Ta Phrom is, for the majority of visitors, the most romantic experience of Angkor and even Historians have noted its mystical charm. As a result, its photogenic and atmospheric combination of trees growing out of the ruins made such unique and exotic filming backdrop for Hollywood blockbuster, “Tomb Raider”.</p>
<p>This afternoon, you will be exploring the area with a boat trip on the immense 87 mile long <strong>Tonle Sap Lake</strong>, also known as the ‘Great Lake’ or ‘sea of fresh water', which lies south of Angkor. </p>
<p>The Tonle Sap River links the Mekong River to the southern end of the Great Lake. An unusual characteristic of this river is that its water flow changes direction to run in reverse; the source of this phenomenon is in the Himalayan Mountains of Central Asia. When the snows melt the waters descend southward along the course of the Mekong River and its tributaries, passing through China, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and finally Vietnam. The silted channels of the Mekong River system are insufficient to accommodate the amount of water sent forth by the melting snows and when the Mekong backs up, the impact of the overflow forces the Tonle Sap River to reverse its course each year between July and October and feed into the Great Lake, more than doubling the size of the lake to 1,158 square miles.</p>
<p>Board a local boat and cruise pass floating houses, fish farms and portraying life on the water that dots the landscape. It  get any better than this experience to understand rural Cambodia and also gain a better understanding of a unique ecosystem rich with birds, fish and other wildlife. </p>
<p>Back to the town, observing the students practicing age old carving and finishing techniques at <strong>Chantiers Ecoles (Artisan D'Angkor)</strong>- A local woodworking and stone carving workshop/gallery which aims to reintegrate young Cambodians from rural areas to the creation of traditional cultural artworks. This vocational center trains 650 apprentices each year including 160 in fine arts and crafts trades united in the “Artisan d Angkor” production network.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight Stay:</strong>Amansara Resort</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>Siem Reap// Visit jungle temple of Beng Mealea & visit the “crowning jewel” of Khmer</h5>
<p>Breakfast at the hotel</p>
<p>This morning, drive through local villages and paddy fields explore a remote jungle temple of<strong>Beng Mealea</strong>, located about 75 Km from Siem Reap town, and takes almost 02-hour drive. Beng Mealea is now utterly subsumed by jungle. It was built during the reign of king Suryavarman II (1113-1150). There is extensive carving of scenes from Hindu mythology, including the Churning of the Sea of Milk and Vishnu being borne by the bird god Garuda. Enjoy a short walk through the dense jungle and feel like an explorer when you discover the completely overgrown temple. The remains of Boeng Mealea, which are still partly buried under vegetation, consist of perfectly squared-off sandstone building blocks. The outstanding decoration dates from the first half of the 12th century. </p>
<p>Move on to visit the “crowning jewel” of Khmer architecture and one of Asia's most magnificent archaeological ruins - the religious citadels <strong>of Angkor Wat until sunset</strong>. Constructed under the reign of Suryavarman II (1113-1150), Angkor Wat is one of the largest religious structures in the world and also the national symbol of Cambodia as you may see on the Cambodian national flag, covering an area 480 acres encircled by an enclosure wall nearly four miles long. Angkor Wat is a representation of the Hindu cosmology and is dedicated to the god Vishnu. The five towers of Angkor Wat are the representation of the five peaks of Mount Meru, home of the gods and centre of the Hindu universe. The temple’s greatest sculptural treasure is its 1 mile long bas-relief that wraps around the walls of the outer gallery along with the 2000 figures of Khmer Devas and Apsaras. Surprisingly, it was finished in less than 40 years by innumerable laborers, master builders and stonemasons. The king actually lived to see it finished. Angkor Wat is stunning at any time of the day, but sunrise and sunset are especially beautiful times to watch the play of light on the stones.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Amansara Resort</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>Siem Reap//Visit Kbal Spean, Banteay Srei, Landmine Museum and Banteay Samre</h5>
<p>Full day visit to Kbal Spean, Banteay Srei, Landmine Museum and Banteay Samre with lunch box</p>
<p>After breakfast at hotel you will be transferred to <strong>Kbal Spean</strong>, about 49 km from Raffles Grand Hotel. Kbal Spean  ("Bridge Head") is an Angkorian era archaeological site on the southwest slopes of the Kulen Hills to the northeast of Angkor in Siem Reap District, Siem Reap Province, Cambodia. It is situated along a 50 metres (160 ft) stretch of the Stung Kbal Spean River, 25 kilometres (16 mi) from the main Angkor group of monuments. The site consists of a series of stone carvings in sandstone formations carved in the river bed and banks.It is commonly known as the "Valley of a 1000 Lingas" or "The River of a Thousand Lingas". The motifs for stone carvings are mainly myriads of lingams (phallic symbol of Hindu god Shiva), depicted as neatly arranged bumps that cover the surface of a sandstone bed rock, and lingam-yoni designs. There are also various Hindu mythological motifs, including depictions of the gods Shiva, Vishnu, Brahma, Lakshmi, Rama, and Hanuman, as well as animals (cows and frogs).</p>
<p>Lunch box or lunch at local restaurant (included foods, local bottled water, tea / coffee, soft drinks)</p>
<p>On the way back visit Banteay Srei : It loosely translates to ‘citadel of the women’, but this is a modern appellation that probably refers to the delicate beauty of the carvings. Built at a time when the Khmer Empire was gaining significant power and territory, the temple was constructed by a Brahmin counselor under a powerful king, Rajendravarman and later under Jayavarman V. Banteay. The walls are densely covered with some of the most beautiful, deep and intricate carvings of any Angkorian temple. The temple's relatively small size, pink sandstone construction and ornate design give it a fairyland ambiance. This temple was discovered by French archaeologists in late 1914.</p>
<p>Then continue to visit Landmine museum : Founded in 1997 by ex-child soldier Aki Ra, the Cambodia Landmine Museum tells the story of his rise from a 10 year old fighter in the Khmer Rouge to his present place as an internationally recognized hero. The Museum tells the story of landmines in Cambodia and the country's continuing efforts to rid itself of the aftermath of over 35 years of warfare. Here you can see (defused and safe) landmines up close, find out how they work and how you can help Cambodia and the rest of the world in the on-going efforts of clearing these weapons from the face of the earth. In 2010 Aki Ra was chosen by CNN as one of its Top 10 Heroes of the Year.
    To conclude the sightseeing with <strong>Banteay Samre Temple</strong>: Banteay Samre temple is about 400 meters east of East Baray, about 2 kilometers from Pradak village and south of the road from Pradak to Phnom Bok. The temple was built in the middle of the 12th century by King Suryavar-man II, it is dedicated to Visnu Brahmaninsm. The proportions of Banteay Samre are splendid. A unique feature is an interior moat with laterite paving, which when filled with water must have given an ethereal atmosphere to the temple. All of the structures around the moat are on a raised base with horizontal moldings, decorated in some areas with figures framed by lotus buds.
