<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 9 days </p>
<p>Cruise for three nights on board the luxurious Nile cruiser Sanctuary 'Sun Boat IV', named top small cruise ship by Conde Nast Traveler. Discover the heritage of the Nubian people with a visit to one of their villages. Sail aboard an authentic Egyptian felucca around the Aswan Islands. Enjoy afternoon tea on the Victorian-inspired terrace at the historic Sofitel Legend Old Cataract hotel.</p>
</li>

<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>ARRIVE IN CAIRO</h5>
<p>Arrive in Cairo, the largest city in Africa and the hub of your adventure through milennia of history. Meet your A&K representative, who escorts you to your hotel.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Fairmont Nile City</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>CAIRO / Pyramids of Giza</h5>
<p>This afternoon, visit the Giza Plateau to view one of the world's truly iconic sights: the pyramids of Mycerinus and Chefren and the Great Pyramid of Cheops, the last surviving structure of the Seven Wonders of the
Ancient World and, for much of its existence, the tallest manmade structure on earth. Standing guard before the pyramid of Chefren is the Great Sphinx, the largest statue ever carved from a single piece of stone. This enigmatic figure depicts a pharaoh with the body of a lion, though who the figure represents is unknown. Continue to the Solar Boat Museum, which houses Cheops' 142-foot funerary boat, perhaps the single most important archaeological find in Egypt since the tomb of Tutankhamun. Get to know your fellow guests at tonight's welcome dinner.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Fairmont Nile City<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>ABU SIMBEL / The Twin Temples</h5>
<p>Early this morning, fly south to Abu Simbel, site of the magnificent twin temples of Ramses II and his wife, Queen Nefertari. The four towering sculptures of Ramses (each nearly 70 feet tall) are impressive enough; even more astonishing, this entire site was disassembled and moved to its present location to save it from flooding in the waters of the Aswan High Dam. Following your visit, take a short flight to Aswan and enjoy afternoon tea and the Nile views from the terrace of your hotel. Later, pay a visit to the Nubian Museum, home to many rare artifacts and mummies from this distinct Nile-dwelling culture.
</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Sofitel Legend Old Cataract Aswan<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>ASWAN / Temple of Philae</h5>
<p>Begin the day with a visit to the granite quarries to view the enormous Unfinished Obelisk, a 1,200-ton block that showcases the outstanding skills of ancient Egypt's stonemasons. From here, take a short boat ride to the exquisite temple of Philae on the island of Agilika. Like Abu Simbel, this temple was dismantled and reconstructed to prevent its eventual destruction by the Nile floodwaters. Later, step off the beaten track when you discover the less-visited temple of Nubian Egypt, Kalabsha, constructed around 30 BC. Continue overland to your five-star deluxe Nile cruise boat, Sanctuary 'Sun Boat IV.' This afternoon, sail in a traditional Nile felucca and continue your discovery of Nubian culture and heritage with a visit to a traditional Nubian village.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Sanctuary 'Sun Boat IV'<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>CRUISING THE NILE / Kom Ombo to Edfu</h5>
<p>After a morning at leisure, take part in a cooking lesson and a chance to help prepare this afternoon's lunch hosted by your onboard chef. Your next port of call is Kom Ombo, where you visit its lovely Greco-Roman temple. Kom Ombo is unique for having been dedicated to two gods, Haroeris and Sobek, and its construction mirrors this dual focus. Mummified crocodiles were also discovered near the site, and a few are on display here. Return to Sanctuary 'Sun Boat IV' for a leisurely sail to Edfu, where you explore the beautifully preserved Temple of Horus, the falcon god, built in 230 BC. The temple spent much of the modern era buried in sand and debris, thus preserving its colorful murals from the ravages of time. This evening's dinner on board is an "Egyptian Night" costume party, with a chance to don traditional galabeyyas (long robes) and enjoy a buffet of savory Egyptian cuisine, followed by music and dancing.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Sanctuary 'Sun Boat IV'<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>CRUISING THE NILE / Luxor</h5>
<p>This morning, tour the famed temple of Luxor, built in 1400 BC and containing, among other wonders, a Christian mural dating from the 10th century. Visit the neighboring temple of Karnak, an awe-inspiring complex built by a succession of pharaohs over two millennia. Its highlight is the great Hypostyle Hall, a forest of towering stone columns spanning an area greater than Notre Dame cathedral. After lunch, explore the west bank of the Nile, the famous necropolis of Thebes where many of Egypt's pharaohs were laid to rest. Begin in the Valley of the Kings, the burial ground of the pharaohs of the New Kingdom, including Tutankhamun. Continue to the lovely, terraced mortuary temple of Queen Hatshepsut, Egypt's first female pharaoh, and end with a stop at the Colossi of Memnon, two gargantuan statues of Amenhotep III.</p>

<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Sanctuary 'Sun Boat IV'<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>CAIRO / The Ancient City</h5>
<p>Bid farewell to Sanctuary 'Sun Boat IV' before your return flight to Cairo. On arriving, embark on a sightseeing excursion to Old Cairo and its Coptic area. Explore the remains of the Fortress of Babylon, built in the sixth century BC, as well as the oldest synagogue in Egypt, Ben Ezra. In this basilica-style temple were found the Cairo Geniza documents, an invaluable source of information about the life of the Jews in Egypt's past. You also visit the Coptic Museum, with its many fine examples of pagan and Christian art. Return to your hotel and spend the afternoon at leisure.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Fairmont Nile City<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 8</h4>
<h5>CAIRO / The Pharaohs' Treasures</h5>
<p>Visit the world-famous Egyptian Museum of Antiquities, home to over 120,000 relics of ancient Egypt. While your guide introduces you to many stunning sights, none are as awe-inspiring as the Mummy Room, where some of ancient Egypt's pharaohs and nobility lie in state, and the treasures of Tutankhamun's tomb, including his priceless gold funerary mask.

Hugging the Atlantic coast road we journey past the bikini beaches of Clifton, Camps Bay and Llandudno, beautifully located at the base of the towering Twelve Apostles Mountains. We travel over the Suikerbossie (Sugar Bush) Pass and descend into the bucolic Hout Bay valley, with its bustling fishing harbour, white sand beach and picturesque village.<br /></p><p align=justify>In Hout Bay we will cruise the waters to Seal Island, home to the Cape Fur Seal. It is a wondrous show to behold - a water ballet by a thousand seals, pirouetting, diving and surfacing to a symphony of gull cries, timpani courtesy of the South Atlantic swell gently keeping time against the ancient granite shore. If you want to see a special part of the Peninsula from another perspective, this is about as good as it gets.</p><p align=justify>We travel over the famous Chapman's Peak Drive (subject to road conditions) to join the sea again at the town of Noordhoek. This historic road, high on the mountainside overlooking the sea, was once considered impossible to build, but Charl Marais (mining surveyor) rose to the challenge and Chapman's Peak Drive was opened to the public in 1922. Our journey continues to the Cape of Good Hope Nature Reserve at the end of the Cape Peninsula.</p><p align=justify>The reserve, which covers 22000 acres of land, converges in the south at Cape Point, a great pinnacle of rock. You can climb the steps or ride a funicular railway - the Flying Dutchman - to the top from where you may see southern right whales in spring and early summer, dolphins and a variety of seabirds. The original lighthouse at Cape Point was built in 1860.</p><p align=justify>The present lighthouse, one of the most powerful in the southern hemisphere, is closer to the point itself than the original. An alternative option (for the more energetic) is to take a scenic cliff-top trail to the Cape of Good Hope itself, the most south-westerly point in Africa, where your guide and vehicle would meet you.

We continue to Kalk Bay the quaint fishing hamlet on the False Bay coast with a protected little harbour of brightly painted wooden boats.</p><p align=justify>The narrow main street is renowned for antique and art shops which make fascinating browsing. We lunch in Kalk Bay before journeying back into Cape Town via Boyes Drive for wonderful views of the harbour. We emerge above Muizenberg a famous location in South African history as it was the site of the Battle of Muizenberg in 1795 when British forces invaded the Cape and defeated the Dutch colonists.</p><p align=justify>We travel back towards Cape Town passing through the attractive, up-market suburb of Constantia, the cradle of the South African wine industry boasting famous estates like Klein Constantia. We continue to Streetwires passing interesting sites such as the University of Cape Town, Rhodes Memorial and Mostert's Mill, a Dutch windmill dating back to 1797 and still in working order.&nbsp;</p><p align=justify>Thereafter we return to the hotel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";

This World Heritage Site is one of the places where man is believed to have originated.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You will visit the private, working site of Drimolen which was only discovered in 1992 and is already the third richest hominid site in Southern Africa. Access to this site is by arrangement only. On 26 April 2000, the discovery of the most complete female Australopithecus robustus skull along with a complete male jaw which made world headlines.&nbsp;</p><p>This site has unearthed 79 hominid fossils, a wealth of faunal remains and some fossil Homo babies. As the site is being excavated all year round, it provides an excellent opportunity to see an excavation in progress. On arrival at Drimolen, you will be served tea, coffee and refreshments at a secluded picnic site while a short fossil cast demonstration and talk on human evolution is presented by a scientist.&nbsp;</p><p>This will be followed by a guided tour of the actual fossilferous deposit of Drimolen where fossils at least 1.2 million years old may be viewed. A light, catered picnic lunch will be provided under the trees, before heading back to Johannesburg for a guided visit of the South African Museum of Rock Art at the Origins Centre. This world-class facility was recently opened at the University of the Witwatersrand. The museum has an outstanding, and fascinating, collection of rock paintings, engravings and artifacts, but more importantly, the history of South Africa is told through the art of the San people. If we want to understand the culture, the spiritual beliefs, and the very essence of the Zulu and Xhosa people as they are today, and even the reasons for the development of Soweto and other townships - we need to take a step back a few hundred years, and follow the path that the rock art stories can tell us.&nbsp;</p><p>Originally San rock art was seen as just pictures of animals and people, and narrative accounts of the hunter-gatherer life. Only now have researchers discovered the spiritual meaning behind the rock art, and their importance. Rock paintings and engravings have proved a valuable tool for Nature Conservationists, as the San provided historical evidence of wildlife species that occurred in their area hundreds of years ago.</p><p>Return to your hotel in the late afternoon.</p>";

Funds are raised for CCF to support their efforts in releasing trapped, wild cheetah and non-lethal predator control methods (i.e. placement of guard dogs in Namibian farmlands). Cheetah Outreach was founded by Annie Beckhelling in January 1997 on a hectare of land donated by Spier. The education programme began with two cheetahs: Inca (6-year old male) whose role was to greet visitors at Spier and Shadow (1-year old male) who travelled to community events.</p><p align=justify>At Spier, with an annual visitor-ship of 650,000 people, the cheetah ambassadors are able to greet more than 10% of the guests. Since our successful beginning, Cheetah Outreach quickly expanded with the arrival of three cubs in September 1997. Nyana-Spier, Charlie-Girl and Moya enjoyed the public attention.

The aim is to bridge the gap between the wild world of the Baboons and the civilised world of their human cousins.</p><p>The remaining Chacma Baboons on the southern peninsula (close to Cape Town), face a bleak future as continued urbanization reduces wilderness areas, resulting in on-going conflict situations between man and baboon. Due to the unacceptably high mortality rates it was predicted that within 15 years the baboons would face certain extinction. At the current mortality rate there will not be a viable baboon population on the peninsula within the next 10 years.</p><p>The Baboon Monitor Project was started in 1999 and over the past five years has considerably reduced the conflicts between primates by keeping baboons out of villages for 85% of days. The project employs 8 men from the nearby community of Masiphumelele. These men have been working closely with the baboons and have gained a wealth of wildlife experience as well as developing unique relationships with the baboons of the Da Gama and Slangkop troops. Funding for the Baboon Monitor Project is an on-going concern as pressing social issues dominate the current funding situation in South Africa.</p><p>To support this important conservation initiative, 25% of net proceeds from this walk will be utilized to ensure the continuation of the Baboon Monitor Project. By taking part in this excursion, you are showing your support for this important conservation initiative. You will be guided across the mountains around Cape Town to spend time with the last remaining Chacma Baboons in the Cape Peninsula. For 2-3 hours you will be walking through the mountain fynbos until you encounter the baboons in their home territory.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to sit and watch these fascinating animals as they eat, play and socialize around you.
