<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 10 days</p>
<p>Travel three of Europe's great rivers - the Rhine, the Main and the Danube - on one extraordinary journey taking you from Amsterdam in the Netherlands through Holland and quaint, medieval Bavaria.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>Arrive Amsterdam, Netherlands</h5>
<p>Arrive in Amsterdam, where you are met by your A&K Guardian Angel and transferred privately to your hotel. Cosmopolitan Amsterdam, sometimes referred to as the -Venice of the North's because of its more than 60 miles of canals, is a city that offers the culture, history, food and entertainment of a larger urban area, yet with the ambiance and appeal of a small, quaint town. Your hotel is situated in the heart of the city in a historic 19th-century building on the central Dam Square. Meet your A&K Tour Director and fellow guests at a welcome dinner this evening.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> NH Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong>D
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Amsterdam & Haarlem</h5>
<p>After breakfast this morning, set out on a full day�s excursion to medieval Haarlem, made famous by the 17th-century masters who established the Golden Age of Dutch painting. Stop at Grote Markt, the main square and centerpiece location of the town�s most famous buildings. Visit St. Bavo Cathedral, built in the 14th and 15th centuries. Since 1738, it has been home to the M�ller Organ, which at more than 98 feet high covers the entire west wall of the church. The organ, still in use today, was played by both Mozart and H�ndel. Also visit the Frans Hals Museum, which traces the evolution of the Dutch masters through an impressive collection of art dating from the 15th century onwards; there is also a lovely garden on the grounds. You then transfer to =Amadeus Brilliant,� moored in Amsterdam, for embarkation. There is time to unpack and relax in the lounge, mingling with your fellow guests. A cocktail reception is followed by dinner on board.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> 'Amadeus Brilliant'<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>Amsterdam to Nijmegen, Holland</h5>
<p>After breakfast, take a private tour of Amsterdam that includes the Royal Palace, one of three residences used by the Dutch Royal House. You also see the Museum Quarter, a posh neighborhood that contains Amsterdam�s largest park. Then, board a canal boat for a cruise that offers a unique perspective of the city. During lunch back on board, =Amadeus Brilliant� begins cruising along the Amsterdam-Rhine Canal through the immaculate landscape of southern Holland. This is your first chance to take in the windmill-dotted Dutch lowlands, their boundaries marked by dikes built to hold back the river waters. Later this afternoon, gather privately for cocktails and snacks in the ship�s Amadeus Club, hosted by your A&K Tour Director. The ship then moors in Nijmegen, the oldest city in the Netherlands, known to the world for the World War II operation that inspired the book and film A Bridge Too Far. After dinner on board, enjoy a traditional Dutch folklore show.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> 'Amadeus Brilliant'<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>Cologne, Germany</h5>
<p>This morning, relax on the Sun Deck as the ship cruises to Cologne in Germany, perhaps playing a game of shuffleboard, unwinding with a good book from the on-board library or simply watching the scenery go by. The Rhine is still a crucial commercial lifeline through Europe and you are likely to spot many commercial as well as leisure craft sharing the river with you. After lunch on board, take a private walking tour of the city. Situated on the River Rhine, Cologne has been an important trading center since Roman times. Its 13th-century cathedral, a masterwork of Gothic architecture, is one of the finest ecclesiastical buildings in the world and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The cathedral�s twin spires � each more than 500 feet high � are the focal point of the city. Take time to explore on your own this afternoon; there are many noteworthy museums, including the Farina Fragrance Museum, which commemorates the region�s signature perfume, eau de cologne. Return to the ship to begin your cruise to Koblenz during dinner this evening.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong>'Amadeus Brilliant'<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>Koblenz/R�desheim</h5>
<p>Today�s cruise takes you along a classic stretch of the Rhine Valley, where the wide river gradually narrows and the landscape on either side grows more hilly, with vineyards and castles seen in the distance. Arrive in Koblenz this morning and disembark with your A&K Tour Director for a brief overview of the town. Situated at the confluence of the Rivers Rhine and Moselle, 2,000-year-old Koblenz has an abundance of historical buildings and an atmospheric river promenade. The ship then follows the winding river to the winemaking town of R�desheim, passing by famous Lorelei Rock, inspiration for numerous enchanting tales throughout recent German history. Arrive in R�desheim, where your A&K Tour Director again offers an overview tour in the late afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> 'Amadeus Brilliant'<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>Miltenberg/Wertheim</h5>
<p>Leave the Rhine today for one of its foremost tributaries, the Main, as =Amadeus Brilliant� reveals even more picturesque and charming countryside en route to Miltenberg, a small picturesque town on a bend in the river. You may take an optional walking tour of the town, continuing to Wertheim, where you rejoin the ship; Wertheim�s medieval town center, complete with castle and half-timbered houses, is particularly charming. If you choose to stay on board today, perhaps enjoy an on-board massage or a visit to the fitness room. During dinner, the ship begins its cruise to W�rzburg.</p>

<p>Moor in W�rzburg during the breakfast hour. Later in the morning, take a walking tour of the city that includes a visit to the Residenz, an 18th-century baroque palace that is famous for its great marble staircase and frescoes. Enjoy a wine tasting at a well-known vineyard before returning to the ship for lunch on board. In the afternoon, there is an optional excursion to medieval Rothenburg, a city seemingly frozen in time. So well preserved and unique are its centuries-old buildings and courtyards that during World War II, German forces surrendered the town rather than risk it being destroyed by Allied bombing. Alternatively, simply relax on board or spend additional time exploring W�rzburg at your leisure. This evening, the captain welcomes you to a very special dinner on board with music provided by the ship�s orchestra.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> 'Amadeus Brilliant'<br />

Built on seven hills, Bamberg is known for its beautiful medieval architecture � as well as its nine breweries. The ship begins its cruise along the Main-Danube Canal toward Nuremberg this evening; its complex array of locks is among the most impressive in all of Europe, raising =Amadeus Brilliant� more than 600 feet above the Main�s natural elevation.

						description = description + "<p align=justify>Meet the guide this morning in the reception area of the hotel for a full day Family tour of the Cape Point.</p><p align=justify>This tour will take us south of Cape Town city centre to the very end of the scenically dramatic Cape Peninsula. Hugging the Atlantic coast road we journey past the bikini beaches of Clifton, Camps Bay and Llandudno, beautifully located at the base of the towering Twelve Apostles Mountains. We travel over the Suikerbossie (Sugar Bush) Pass and descend into the bucolic Hout Bay valley, with its bustling fishing harbour, white sand beach and picturesque village.<br /></p><p align=justify>In Hout Bay we will cruise the waters to Seal Island, home to the Cape Fur Seal. It is a wondrous show to behold - a water ballet by a thousand seals, pirouetting, diving and surfacing to a symphony of gull cries, timpani courtesy of the South Atlantic swell gently keeping time against the ancient granite shore. If you want to see a special part of the Peninsula from another perspective, this is about as good as it gets.</p><p align=justify>We travel over the famous Chapman's Peak Drive (subject to road conditions) to join the sea again at the town of Noordhoek. This historic road, high on the mountainside overlooking the sea, was once considered impossible to build, but Charl Marais (mining surveyor) rose to the challenge and Chapman's Peak Drive was opened to the public in 1922. Our journey continues to the Cape of Good Hope Nature Reserve at the end of the Cape Peninsula.</p><p align=justify>The reserve, which covers 22000 acres of land, converges in the south at Cape Point, a great pinnacle of rock. You can climb the steps or ride a funicular railway - the Flying Dutchman - to the top from where you may see southern right whales in spring and early summer, dolphins and a variety of seabirds. The original lighthouse at Cape Point was built in 1860.</p><p align=justify>The present lighthouse, one of the most powerful in the southern hemisphere, is closer to the point itself than the original. An alternative option (for the more energetic) is to take a scenic cliff-top trail to the Cape of Good Hope itself, the most south-westerly point in Africa, where your guide and vehicle would meet you. Afterwards we travel back through the reserve looking out for some of the animals that live here, including the rare Bontebok, Eland, Cape Mountain Zebra and Ostrich.</p><p align=justify>En route to lunch we visit Boulders, a lovely beach sheltered from the wind and famous for its colony of endangered Jackass Penguins on the coast of False Bay near Simon's Town. Boulders, had just two breeding pairs in 1982, but thanks to careful management the population has grown to about 3000 in recent years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p align=justify>Pass through Simon's Town, which was the Royal Navy's main base in the south Atlantic from 1815 until 1957 and has the feel of a small English seaside village with steep narrow streets and cobbled alleyways. You will learn about the famous hound called Just Nuisance, the most renowned animal in the annals of the Royal Navy. We continue to Kalk Bay the quaint fishing hamlet on the False Bay coast with a protected little harbour of brightly painted wooden boats.</p><p align=justify>The narrow main street is renowned for antique and art shops which make fascinating browsing. We lunch in Kalk Bay before journeying back into Cape Town via Boyes Drive for wonderful views of the harbour. We emerge above Muizenberg a famous location in South African history as it was the site of the Battle of Muizenberg in 1795 when British forces invaded the Cape and defeated the Dutch colonists.</p><p align=justify>We travel back towards Cape Town passing through the attractive, up-market suburb of Constantia, the cradle of the South African wine industry boasting famous estates like Klein Constantia. We continue to Streetwires passing interesting sites such as the University of Cape Town, Rhodes Memorial and Mostert's Mill, a Dutch windmill dating back to 1797 and still in working order.&nbsp;</p><p align=justify>Thereafter we return to the hotel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";

This World Heritage Site is one of the places where man is believed to have originated.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You will visit the private, working site of Drimolen which was only discovered in 1992 and is already the third richest hominid site in Southern Africa. Access to this site is by arrangement only. On 26 April 2000, the discovery of the most complete female Australopithecus robustus skull along with a complete male jaw which made world headlines.&nbsp;</p><p>This site has unearthed 79 hominid fossils, a wealth of faunal remains and some fossil Homo babies. As the site is being excavated all year round, it provides an excellent opportunity to see an excavation in progress. On arrival at Drimolen, you will be served tea, coffee and refreshments at a secluded picnic site while a short fossil cast demonstration and talk on human evolution is presented by a scientist.&nbsp;</p><p>This will be followed by a guided tour of the actual fossilferous deposit of Drimolen where fossils at least 1.2 million years old may be viewed. A light, catered picnic lunch will be provided under the trees, before heading back to Johannesburg for a guided visit of the South African Museum of Rock Art at the Origins Centre. This world-class facility was recently opened at the University of the Witwatersrand. The museum has an outstanding, and fascinating, collection of rock paintings, engravings and artifacts, but more importantly, the history of South Africa is told through the art of the San people. If we want to understand the culture, the spiritual beliefs, and the very essence of the Zulu and Xhosa people as they are today, and even the reasons for the development of Soweto and other townships - we need to take a step back a few hundred years, and follow the path that the rock art stories can tell us.&nbsp;</p><p>Originally San rock art was seen as just pictures of animals and people, and narrative accounts of the hunter-gatherer life. Only now have researchers discovered the spiritual meaning behind the rock art, and their importance. Rock paintings and engravings have proved a valuable tool for Nature Conservationists, as the San provided historical evidence of wildlife species that occurred in their area hundreds of years ago.</p><p>Return to your hotel in the late afternoon.</p>";

Funds are raised for CCF to support their efforts in releasing trapped, wild cheetah and non-lethal predator control methods (i.e. placement of guard dogs in Namibian farmlands). Cheetah Outreach was founded by Annie Beckhelling in January 1997 on a hectare of land donated by Spier. The education programme began with two cheetahs: Inca (6-year old male) whose role was to greet visitors at Spier and Shadow (1-year old male) who travelled to community events.</p><p align=justify>At Spier, with an annual visitor-ship of 650,000 people, the cheetah ambassadors are able to greet more than 10% of the guests. Since our successful beginning, Cheetah Outreach quickly expanded with the arrival of three cubs in September 1997. Nyana-Spier, Charlie-Girl and Moya enjoyed the public attention.

The aim is to bridge the gap between the wild world of the Baboons and the civilised world of their human cousins.</p><p>The remaining Chacma Baboons on the southern peninsula (close to Cape Town), face a bleak future as continued urbanization reduces wilderness areas, resulting in on-going conflict situations between man and baboon. Due to the unacceptably high mortality rates it was predicted that within 15 years the baboons would face certain extinction. At the current mortality rate there will not be a viable baboon population on the peninsula within the next 10 years.</p><p>The Baboon Monitor Project was started in 1999 and over the past five years has considerably reduced the conflicts between primates by keeping baboons out of villages for 85% of days. The project employs 8 men from the nearby community of Masiphumelele. These men have been working closely with the baboons and have gained a wealth of wildlife experience as well as developing unique relationships with the baboons of the Da Gama and Slangkop troops. Funding for the Baboon Monitor Project is an on-going concern as pressing social issues dominate the current funding situation in South Africa.</p><p>To support this important conservation initiative, 25% of net proceeds from this walk will be utilized to ensure the continuation of the Baboon Monitor Project. By taking part in this excursion, you are showing your support for this important conservation initiative. You will be guided across the mountains around Cape Town to spend time with the last remaining Chacma Baboons in the Cape Peninsula. For 2-3 hours you will be walking through the mountain fynbos until you encounter the baboons in their home territory.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to sit and watch these fascinating animals as they eat, play and socialize around you.
