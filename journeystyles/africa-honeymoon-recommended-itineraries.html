Established in 1951, and covering an area of almost 15,000 sq km, an area comparable to the state of Connecticut or Northern Ireland, the Serengeti hosts a fantastically diverse ecosystem. The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, where 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other plains game that follow close behind, make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";

<p>Take an early flight by a private aircraft to the Victoria Lake. Try your hand at fishing for the legendary giant Nile perch found in these waters as you discover the numerous tiny islands or stop by at a traditional fishing village and learn about the lives of the villagers and their day to day chores, before flying back to the Maasai Mara.</p>
<p>Sanctuary Olonana is located in almost exactly the same spot where the Masai Mara scenes in “Out of Africa” were filmed. Experience a special “Out of Africa” picnic lunch in homage to that magical scene in the film with Meryl Streep, Robert Redford and that wonderful gramophone!

After an enjoyable silver service dinner, you retire to the crackling campfire where night caps are served.  Quietly absorbing the peace and beauty of an African night, romancing under the open sky you will be amazingly surprised as chaos suddenly erupts with the sound of the Maasai battle cry.  From trees and scrub leap long-limbed ochred warriors all brandishing long gleaming spears so prized by the Masai tribe. This is a mock charge by a group of Masai Moran (warriors) breathtaking in its authenticity!  As you settle down, after absorbing the shock  with your glasses refilled and laughter abated, the Moran demonstrate some traditional dances and their legendary gravity-defying leaps, their proud profiles and spearheads reflecting the amber light of the flames.</p>

Enjoy a full day exploring the Serengeti by 4WD vehicle with thrilling morning and afternoon game drives. Whether this is your first time on safari or a return trip the Serengeti will not disappoint.<br /><br />The Serengeti National Park is arguably the most famous national park in the world. The Serengeti perhaps defines the safari experience as surely as the wildlife that inhabits it. Established in 1951, and covering an area of almost 15,000 sq km, an area comparable to the state of Connecticut or Northern Ireland, the Serengeti hosts a fantastically diverse ecosystem. The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, where 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other plains game that follow close behind, make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";
