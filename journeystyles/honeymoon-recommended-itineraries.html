Enjoy a picnic lunch amongst the hippos and birds before visiting a Maasai village this afternoon.<br /><br />The floor of the crater is only 100 sq miles but is home to around 30,000 animals with a high concentration of predators and some of the finest black-maned lions in Africa. Rhinos can often be seen with calves at heel. Eland and waterbuck appear not to notice the human visitors, enabling photographers to shoot at ease. On the lake in the middle of the crater you may see thousands of flamingos fluttering and shimmering like a pink heat haze. Zebra and wildebeest account for almost half the animals. Gazelle, buffalo, eland, hartebeest and wart hog can also be seen.<br /></p>";

You will be taken to one of Wonders of the World: The statue of Christ the Redeemer, which crowns the top of the Corcovado mountain with stunning views of Guanabara Bay, Sugar Loaf and the beaches of Copacabana and Ipanema below.

<h5>Rio de Janeiro / Samba Class & Shall we dance</h5>
<p>Samba Dance Class at the prestigious dancing school of Carlinhos de Jesus. Rio de Janeiro is the birthplace of samba. It's impossible to resist the most Brazilian of all beats. You listen to it, and before you notice your feet are tapping, your fingers snapping! If only you knew how to dance it the way locals do... Well, you can. With a 2-hour lesson you’ll be ready to do the basic samba steps and body movements, and before you know it you will be dancing really well! Tonight dinner will be at Rio Scenarium which if there was an award for most beautiful bar, it would certainly deserve it. Located in a renovated warehouse on the edge of Lapa, it is an antique store-turned-bar which serves a wide range of seafood and traditional Brazilian dishes. There is also a stage on the main floor where live Brazilian samba and choro bands will be playing as well as dance floor in case you want to samba the night away. This is the perfect place to practice the moves you learnt earlier today.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Fasano, Rio De Janeiro</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>Rio de Janeiro Florianopolis</h5>
<p>Morning at leisure to relax on the beach or linger at sidewalk cafes or take in an optional tour. In the afternoon, fly to Florianopolis. Upon arrival at Florianopolis airport, you will be met by your guide who will take you to paradise. The destination is Ganchos. Thats how it was baptized by its founders: Azorean immigrants who settled on this lush, mountainous, cove-studded peninsula, more than two hundred years ago at the height of the whaling boom. Some decades ago, the small city was renamed as Governador Celso Ramos. Protected from people’s curiosity as by its topography, Ganchos has to this day remained one of the last surviving secrets of the Brazilian coast.</p>
<p>More than just natural beauty, a whole way of life has been preserved here. The colonists descendants still make their living from the sea – nowadays cultivating oysters, scallops and other shellfish.</p>
<p>You leave the main road behind and eight miles further on you find yourself winding along through a succession of villages strung along the north-facing peninsula as though frozen in time. Slow down. The coast road passes hard by the picturesque colonial style houses, as calm little bays come into view one by one, the water dotted with the simple boats and mollusk farmers colored buoys.</p>
<p>At the end of an unassuming lane, a gate will open to reveal the most amazing spot on the whole peninsula.</p>
<p>Welcome to Ponta dos Ganchos.</p>
<p>Be warned in advance: it’s not easy to leave the bungalow. Well, of course, the instant you call for one, an electric car will appear at your door in a flash. Nevertheless, sometimes it is going to be difficult to want to leave.<br>
It might be because of the therapeutic mattress or perhaps, it is because there are just too many threads in the Egyptian cotton sheets. Sometimes the espresso machine or the organic snacks next to it in the mini-bar are to blame.<br>
Other times it will be a combination of things – your private wine cellar will join forces with the view of the sunset over the bay to prevent you from venturing beyond the terrace. This is the reason why breakfast is like a miniature gourmet festival – a parade of delicacies served in dainty portions. Providing a little competition for the terrace of your bungalow is a little stone island just in front of the beach that you can reach swimming or along a catwalk.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong>Ponta dos Ganchos, Florianopolis</p>

The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, where 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other plains game that follow close behind, make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";

The Ngorongoro Crater is the largest unbroken caldera in the world and the first sight of it is breathtaking.<br /><br />Ngorongoro Crater Lodge is situated on the edge of the ancient crater rim above the cool, swirling mists. The lodge is a return to the noble elegance of the travelling colonials. Inspired in design by the Maasai Manyatta, three separate camps of 6 to 12 suites each remember a bygone era when characters such as Lord Delamere adorned the stilted, handcrafted structures with graceful antiques, grand chandeliers and treasures collected from travels through Africa.<br /><br /></p>";

Rhinos can often be seen with calves at heel. Eland and waterbuck appear not to notice the human visitors, enabling photographers to shoot at ease.

Erotic and passionate, haunting and melancholic, it involves not only the body but also the soul.

Enjoy a full day exploring the Serengeti by 4WD vehicle with thrilling morning and afternoon game drives. Whether this is your first time on safari or a return trip the Serengeti will not disappoint.<br /><br />The Serengeti National Park is arguably the most famous national park in the world. The Serengeti perhaps defines the safari experience as surely as the wildlife that inhabits it. Established in 1951, and covering an area of almost 15,000 sq km, an area comparable to the state of Connecticut or Northern Ireland, the Serengeti hosts a fantastically diverse ecosystem. The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, where 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other plains game that follow close behind, make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";

All excursions are escorted by an experienced armed guide.<br /><br />Selous Sand Rivers is situated on the banks of the Rufiji River, offering a unique combination of adventure, comfort and exclusivity. This small luxury lodge, crafted out of local materials, comprises six individually designed cottages with en-suite bathrooms. Spaced along the river bank, each has its own private view of the wide sand-banked river with its hippos, crocodiles and birdlife.

The Selous supports around one million game animals, is bigger than Switzerland and is a World Heritage site.

Transfer from Arusha to Ngorongoro Crater Lodge located on the rim with spectacular views across the crater. The Ngorongoro Crater is the largest unbroken caldera in the world and the first sight of it is breathtaking.<br /><br />Ngorongoro Crater Lodge is situated on the edge of the ancient crater rim above the cool, swirling mists. The lodge is a return to the noble elegance of the travelling colonials. Inspired in design by the Maasai Manyatta, three separate camps of 6 to 12 suites each remember a bygone era when characters such as Lord Delamere adorned the stilted, handcrafted structures with graceful antiques, grand chandeliers and treasures collected from travels through Africa.<br /><br /></p>";

Rhinos can often be seen with calves at heel. Eland and waterbuck appear not to notice the human visitors, enabling photographers to shoot at ease. On the lake in the middle of the crater you may see thousands of flamingos fluttering and shimmering like a pink heat haze. Zebra and wildebeest account for almost half the animals.
