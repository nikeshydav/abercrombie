<p>Arrive in Ho Chi Minh City, meet your guide and start to visit Cu Chi, a small community located in the northwest of Ho Chi Minh City, which gained notoriety for its network of deep tunnels that provided shelter and an effective source of infiltration for the Viet Cong during the later years of the Vietnam War.  The tunnels, which reached hundreds of miles in total length, housed storage rooms, make-shift hospitals and sleeping quarters that accommodated rebel fighters for up to two weeks at a time.  Heavy bombing by U.S. forces did not halt movement through the tunnels, making this an unusually successful defense against the superior weaponry of the American troops.</p>

<h5>Detailed Itinerary</h5>
<h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>ARRIVE YANGON–Sightseeing and special dinner at Le Planteur, a beautiful French restaurant </h5>
<p>On arrival at the Yangon airport, you will be welcomed by an A&K Representative, who will assist you through all the immigration procedures. You will be transferred to the hotel in a private vehicle and assisted with check-in and a special Burmese wedding present awaits you.</p>

<p>En-route to your hotel, halt in town for a foot massage at Yangon’s best spa. This is the perfect way to relax and unwind after a long international flight.</p>

<p>Depending on your arrival time, we recommend having lunch at Monsoon restaurant to relish freshly prepared authentic Myanmar cuisine.</p>

<p>This afternoon, enjoy a private tour of Yangon's colonial city centre, with its many cultural delights along with an English speaking private guide. Yangon, formerly known as Rangoon, is a fairly quiet and appealing city with an impressive colonial and spiritual heritage. Travel past faded colonial buildings, busy street markets, and scintillating temples. Visit the Reclining Buddha, one of Myanmar’s largest icons at 230 feet long.</p>

<p>The tour ends at the magnificent Shwedagon Pagoda the most revered Buddhist temple in Myanmar. Although the origins of the pagoda are vague, the local legend states that the original structure was built 25 centuries ago and renovated several times before taking its current structure as we see it today in the 15th century. The exterior of the shrine is plated with 8,688 solid gold slabs and a giant emerald sits in the middle to catch the first and last rays of the sun. The tip of the stupa, far too high for the human eye to discern in any detail, is set with 5448 diamonds, 2317 rubies, sapphires, and other gems, 1065 golden bells and, at the very top, a single 76-carat diamond. Your private guide will show you around the massive complex and enlighten you on its varied facts. Enjoy breathtaking views of the golden stupa from this vantage point and observe the devout praying, the evocative fragrance of incense enveloping you.</p>

<p>Enjoy an unforgettable fine dining experience with Felix Eppisser, one of Switzerland’s top Michelin star chefs.  Relish delicately prepared French food in the gardens of a stately colonial house, which appeals romance seekers to Le Planteur. Begin your dinner with a glass of Champagne and a selection of creative canapés, hot and cold. Continue with an elegant four course menu. Your dinner will be accompanied by a group of traditional musicians and dancers and a lovely and elaborate illumination by 1000 candles (not available during the rainy season). You will be transferred a vintage British car (Vauxhall 1947, Austin Somerset 1953 or Morris Oxford 1954). Pair your delicious meal with a wine from their well-stocked wine cellar having a storage capacity of 25,000 bottles with enormous collection that encompasses the world of wines, where affordable “trouvailles” meet the rarest of bottles and vintages.</p>

<p>Return to your hotel room, where a bottle of champagne and special welcome present awaits you to toast your Honeymoon in Myanmar.</p>

<p>Enjoy a sunset cruise on the Ayeyarwaddy River and enjoy a cocktail and canapés on a sand bank.  For many centuries, the mighty Ayeyarwaddy River served as Myanmar’s main artery and crucial highway. Celebrated in legend, myth, song and history, it is still vital to the country, sustaining life of every kind.  The river-scape offers teak dwellings, cheerful waving youngsters, and local women balancing water jugs on their heads. Watch the sun set at a distance in the company of your loved one in these serene surroundings. </p>

<br />
<br />
Disembark and take a tuk-tuk (motorized tricycle) ride to the Grand Palace, which reveals the splendour of early Rattanakosin architecture and is one of the most beautiful examples of an ancient Siamese court. So small and distant that it can hardly be seen, little is known about the famed Emerald Buddha in sacred Wat Phra Kaew Temple, except that it is made of green jade or jasper and denotes independence, strength and good fortune for the country. Within the temple, interior walls are painted with superb frescoes. <br />
