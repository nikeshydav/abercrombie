<p>After breakfast, you make a visit to Duong Lam Village. The ancient village has a history of about 1,200 years with many houses dating back up to 400 years. A special thing about the village is that most of the structures here are made of laterite and mud, abundant in the area. Apart from its historical and tourism values, it is a significant place for scientists to study resident communities in ancient agriculture. You may enjoy lunch in the village before heading back to Hanoi.</p>

<p>Drop by Thang Long theatre to enjoy famous Water Puppet Show, unique Vietnamese traditional art. This ancient art originated in the countryside by the farmers who worked on the paddy fields. The farmers amused themselves during times of flooding, by performing water puppet shows out in the paddy fields. The artists-men and women-stand waist-deep in the water and manipulate the puppets from behind the curtains, making them move about, talk, laugh and even dance on water surface.</p>

<h5>Detailed Itinerary</h5>
<h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>ARRIVE YANGON–Sightseeing and special dinner at Le Planteur, a beautiful French restaurant </h5>
<p>On arrival at the Yangon airport, you will be welcomed by an A&K Representative, who will assist you through all the immigration procedures. You will be transferred to the hotel in a private vehicle and assisted with check-in and a special Burmese wedding present awaits you.</p>

<p>En-route to your hotel, halt in town for a foot massage at Yangon’s best spa. A perfect way to relax and unwind after a long international flight.</p>

<p>Depending on your arrival time, we recommend having lunch at Monsoon restaurant to relish freshly prepared authentic Myanmar cuisine.</p>

<p>This afternoon, enjoy a private tour of Yangon's colonial city centre, with its many cultural delights along with an English speaking private guide. Yangon, formerly known as Rangoon, is a fairly quiet and appealing city with an impressive colonial and spiritual heritage. Travel past faded colonial buildings, busy street markets, and scintillating temples. Visit the Reclining Buddha, one of Myanmar’s largest icons at 230 feet long.</p>

<p>The tour ends at the magnificent Shwedagon Pagoda the most revered Buddhist temple in Myanmar. Although the origins of the pagoda are vague, the local legend states that the original structure was built 25 centuries ago and renovated several times before taking its current structure as we see it today in the 15th century. The exterior of the shrine is plated with 8,688 solid gold slabs and a giant emerald sits in the middle to catch the first and last rays of the sun. The tip of the stupa, far too high for the human eye to discern in any detail, is set with 5448 diamonds, 2317 rubies, sapphires, and other gems, 1065 golden bells and, at the very top, a single 76-carat diamond. Your private guide will show you around the massive complex and enlighten you on its varied facts. Enjoy breathtaking views of the golden stupa from this vantage point and observe the devout praying, the evocative fragrance of incense enveloping you.</p>

<p>Enjoy an unforgettable fine dining experience with Felix Eppisser, one of Switzerland’s top Michelin star chefs.  Relish delicately prepared French food in the gardens of a stately colonial house, which appeals romance seekers to Le Planteur. Begin your dinner with a glass of Champagne and a selection of creative canapés, hot and cold. Continue with an elegant four course menu. Your dinner will be accompanied by a group of traditional musicians and dancers and a lovely and elaborate illumination by 1000 candles (not available during the rainy season). You will be transferred by a vintage British car (Vauxhall 1947, Austin Somerset 1953 or Morris Oxford 1954). Pair your delicious meal with a wine from their well-stocked wine cellar having a storage capacity of 25,000 bottles, an enormous collection that encompasses the world of wines, where affordable “trouvailles” meet the rarest of bottles and vintages.</p>

<p>Return to your hotel room, where a bottle of champagne and special welcome present awaits you to toast your Honeymoon in Myanmar.</p>

<p>After freshening up, the excursion with an English speaking private guide begins on a horse carriage with a visit to an elevated temple with stunning views over the surrounding plains. The excursion is a picture-perfect overview of the grandeur of Bagan’s architecture. Next, visit the Ananda Temple, one of the surviving masterpieces of the Mon architecture. Also famous as the finest, largest, best conserved and most regarded of the Bagan temples.</p>

The other temples close by are two smaller temples with nice Buddha statues and stone work, Manuha Temple and Nan Paya Temple.</p>

<p>Enjoy a sunset cruise on the Ayeyarwaddy River and enjoy a cocktail and canapés on a sand bank.  For many centuries, the mighty Ayeyarwaddy River served as Myanmar’s main artery and crucial highway. Celebrated in legend, myth, song and history, it is still vital to the country, sustaining life of every kind.  The river-scape offers teak dwellings, cheerful waving youngsters, and local women balancing water jugs on their heads. Watch the sun set at a distance in the company of your loved one in these serene surroundings. </p>

<p>The evening will be an exclusive and memorable experience of dining under the stars, on the sand bank, surrounded by torches and dinner will be served accompanied by traditional Burmese music and dancing. </p>
