<dt><h2>BANYAN TREE SEYCHELLES</h2> 
<p>Nestling amongst the swaying palm trees and tropical forest of Intendance Bay, on the main island of Mahé, the Banyan Tree is a romantic hideaway providing a rare taste of paradise. After a day of exploring or lying by the pool, a visit to the Banyan Tree Spa is the ultimate indulgence. Awaken your senses with an invigorating stroll along the beach before breakfast. Once you have worked up an appetite, a delicious spread of fresh fruits, pastries and hot à la carte dishes awaits. </p>
<div class="thepet">
<p>On the Banyan Lagoon I in the company of your personal host and skipper, you can explore the islands of the Seychelles in complete style, stopping whenever you choose for ad hoc lunches, moonlit picnics or a spot of snorkelling. Back on land, a visit to the fabulous spa is an absolute must. All sessions (except beauty & hair treatments) consist of 30 minutes calm time, which includes a footbath before the treatment and a herbal drink served during refreshments & relaxation.</p>
<p>22 Hillside Pool Villas have large bedrooms, a sunken bath and an outside pavilion with living and dining area that leads onto a timber deck with private pool. Four Pool Villas by the Rocks and five Intendance Pool Villas also feature a jet pool, the latter with amazing views of the ocean below. Our favourite for romantic couples are the Beachfront Spa Pool Villas. Each of these has a shower/steam room, larger swimming pool, spa pavilion and outdoor jet pool and shower. But best of all, they also have direct access onto the beach. For families we would recommend the six new Two-Bedroom Double Pool Villas. Just steps from the sand, they come with their own butler, two sprawling master bedrooms, private open-air dining area, two swimming pools and an outdoor jet pool.</p>

<dt><h2>BIRD ISLAND LODGE</h2> 
<p>Bird Island Lodge is all about simplicity and the environment that you are in, there are no telephones and no phones immerse yourself in the beauty of this unspoilt unique island. Conservation plays an important role on the island and the conservation workers like Robbie will guide you through the island enlightening your mind on the different species of birds, turtle and the fauna of the island. If you would like to help out while staying on the island with any of the conservation projects this is also possible. </p>
<div class="thepet">
<p>The cuisine on the island is simple and fresh combining the fresh fish caught daily, with the organic fruit and vegetables as well as hand reared pork from the small farm, fresh tasty food at its best. The turtle laying season is from mid-October to mid-January and the laying season from mid-December to mid-March. Bird Island can claim the highest number of first time records for any single island of the Seychelles. With 112 species recorded in total, they also became the first island to record 100 non-breeding migratory birds. Sooty Terns hover, in their tens of thousands, above their island sanctuary in March and April, before beginning to land in the colony at the northern end of the island from the end of April. Bird Island offers a truly unique experience that is not for everyone, but a very special place that is waiting to be discovered.</p>
