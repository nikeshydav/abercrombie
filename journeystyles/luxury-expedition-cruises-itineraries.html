                                    <h5>LONGYEARBYEN</h5>

                                    <h5>SVALBARD ISLANDS</h5>
                                    <p>Very few people have the opportunity to view the remote wilderness of the Svalbard Islands. In the Svalbard archipelago, polar bears, walrus, Svalbard reindeer and an incredibly rich variety of birds are as abundant as are cathedrals of ice, glaciers and craggy mountain peaks. An amazing amount of diminutive flora surrounds this barren landscape, which comes alive with color under the August midnight sun. </p>
                                    <p>Svalbard’s wildlife is contrasted by the unexpected culture of its fishing villages. Your captain and expedition crew determine the day’s best sightseeing opportunities, which may include these extraordinary regions:</p>
                                    <br/>
                                    <h5>Magdalenefjoren: </h5>
                                    <p>A stunning fjord with rugged rock walls, Magdalenefjoren surmounts blue-hued glaciers crisscrossed by crevasses, with birds perched in the high cliffs. This “glacier coast” provides magnificent views of slow-moving glaciers travelling out to sea as well as beaches frequented by walrus.</p><br/>
                                    <h5>NyAlesund:</h5>
                                    <p>History here stretches back to the early Arctic explorers. Today, a polar research station occupies the site where a Norwegian coal mine once operated, and scientists study meteorology, seismology, atmospheric sciences and marine biology. </p>
                                    <p>Conditions permitting, you visit the small community, including a museum, art gallery and the northernmost post office in the world which is sure to be a life-changing experience.</p>
                                    <h5>Alkjefellet (Auk Mountains):</h5><br/>
                                    <p>Set off on Zodiacs (sturdy inflatable boats) to explore the 325-foot sheer cliffs which are home to 60,000 guillemots and kittiwakes. These nests attract “poaching” polar bears and Arctic fox, who come to feast on eggs and birds, and provide an opportunity to view them safely from the Zodiacs.</p><br/>
                                    <h5>Monaco Bay and Glacier:</h5><br/>
                                    <p>Located in Northwest Spitsbergen, Monaco Bay is frequented by a variety of wildlife population, including polar bears, walrus, harbor and bearded seals, and a multitude of seabirds.</p><br/>
                                    <h5>Liefdefjorden (Loves Bay):</h5><br/>
                                    <p>In far Northern Svalbard, Liefdefjorden is an excellent area for spotting polar bears and other Arctic wildlife.</p>
                                    <p>Throughout the landings and days of cruising in Spitsbergen,an objective will be to search for polar bears as they hunt in their true natural habitat — be it on land or among the ice floes, each landing under the close supervision of the guardians, who have the best knowledge about where to find the white giants.</p>

                                    <p>Comfort yourself as you cruise along the Arctic Ice Edge through the Greenland Sea, as the presenters recap their productions on the wildlife, history and geology of Svalbard, and prepare you for the world’s largest island: Greenland. </p>

                                    <h5>CRUISING THE DRAKE PASSAGE </h5>
                                    <p>The journey towards Antarctica is an exciting one through the Drake Passage. An important trade route in the 19th and early 20th century, the Drake Passage is a 600-mile-wide swath of water where the Southern Ocean currents are squeezed between South America’s southern tip and Antarctica’s northernmost reaches. The stormy waters and icy conditions often make the journey a difficult one, though the stabilizer-equipped ‘Le Boreal’ handles it with ease. As you travel in the comfort of your luxury cruiser, indulge in enriching orations from members of the Expedition Team on topics ranging from bird life and geology, to photography and history. </p>
                                    <p>After a scrumptious lunch, join our naturalists on the deck from where you may spot various species of whales and abundant seabirds, which join other mammals on the krill-rich waters of the Drake Passage; it’s all just a taste of the wildlife you will encounter in the days to come. </p>

                                    <h5> ANTARCTICA </h5>
                                    <p>As the Antarctic Peninsula and its offshore islands appear on the horizon, a sense of excitement begins to build. While day-to-day itineraries depend on weather, water and wildlife conditions, two excursions are carefully planned for each day by the captain and expedition leader.</p>
                                    <p>Each cruise day begins with an early exquisite breakfast. Afterward, venture out to a number of sites in swift Zodiacs (sturdy inflatable boats) where you will be accompanied by expert drivers and lecturers. These sites may include the penguin-filled islands in the South Shetlands of Half Moon, Penguin or Deception; islands off the continental coastline such as Cuverville, Paulet or Vortex  and, weather permitting, the fabled Antarctic Peninsula. You may also sail through Paradise Bay and the Lemaire Channel, referred to as “Kodak Alley” for its stunning, camera-ready vistas of towering icebergs and deep blue waters. </p>
                                    <p>After a morning exploring native species and striking terrain,return to ‘Le Boreal’ for some lip-smacking lunch and perhaps some time to relax and scan the wildlife-rich waters that surround you, where you may spot everything from fin whales, humpback whales and orcas, to imperial shags and the southern giant petrel. </p>
                                    <p>Later in the afternoon, set out for the day’s second excursion, which may include a visit to a working scientific research station, the remains of a turn-of-the-century whaling and sealing station, a sheltered beach teeming with basking elephant seals, or simply circumnavigating colossal icebergs that serve as floating homes to seals and penguins. </p>
                                </p><p>After an exciting day, return to your cruiser to relax and chat over cocktails in the cozy, comfortable lounge and enjoy dinner in the dining room. You may also choose to recap the day’s discoveries with your naturalist guides on deck or seize the opportunity to capture photos in the stunning low light characteristic of Antarctica’s long, ethereal twilight.</p>

The ship’s return through the Drake Passage is an interlude for recap and reflection of the White Continent. Spend time on board with newfound friends in the comfortable common spaces of ‘Le Boreal,’ enjoy quiet relaxation on the private balcony of your cabin or absorb more fascinating talks by your captivating Expedition Team. While cruising through this historic passage, you may spot various species of whales and seabirds, including the elusive albatross and the giant petrel, an opportunistic predator and scavenger nicknamed the “stinker.” The albatross is an especially stunning sight to behold. These wandering birds boast a wingspan of 11.5 feet on average and use their powerful wings to glide through the air for hours at a time in search of food.</p>

                                        <h5>KULLORSUAQ</h5><br/>
                                        Located at the southern end of Melville Bay, Kullorsuaq is the northernmost village in the Upernavik Archipelago, and one of the northernmost settlements in Western Greenland.

                                    <p>The coming days await innumerable exciting excursions which are likely to include:</p>
                                    <p>
                                        <h5>POND INTET</h5><br/>
                                        Located on the Northern end of Baffin Island, Pond Inlet is a noted gateway to the fabled Northwest Passage. You will be assisted with customs formalities for Nunavut, after which you head out for a shore excursion to an area originally inhabited by the Thule. Stop by the Nattinnak Visitor’s Center or ToonoonikSahoonik Co-op, where you may shop artisan carvings made from local red and green soapstone, beautiful wall hangings and various other handicrafts.
                                    </p>
                                    <p><h5>LANCASTER SOUND</h5><br/>
                                    Situated between Devon Island and Baffin Island, this body of water forms the eastern entrance to the Parry Channel and the Northwest Passage. It’s also home to a rich abundance of Arctic cod, which in turn draws copious populations of sea birds and marine mammals. Beluga and endangered bowhead whales, the narwhal with its spiraling tusk, ringed and bearded seals, the enchanting polar bear, and mustached walrus, as well as northern fulmars, black guillemots and Arctic terns — all are among the fantastic wildlife that belong to this area.<br/>
                                    Some may even come into view on exciting Zodiac excursions and landings.
                                    </p>
                                    <p><h5>BEECHEY ISLAND</h5><br/>
                                    Historic moments in Arctic exploration define this island, best known for providing a safe haven to British explorer Sir John Franklin in 1845. Look east, towards Resolute Bay at the huge silhouette of Cape Riley and imagine what Franklin saw here in Erebus Harbour, where he took shelter for two years before his ill-fated attempt to conquer the Northwest Passage. Observe the wooden grave markers for three of Franklin’s men, now bleached by the sun, and visit the cenotaph memorial erected in memory of the lost explorer, a remarkable experience!

                                    <p><h5>GJOA HAVEN</h5><br/>
                                    During his first attempt to transit the Northwest Passage on ‘Gjøa,’ a small fishing vessel, Roald Amundsen used this natural harbor as a respite while waiting for ice conditions to improve. For two years, he lived with the NetsilikInuit, learning their skills of survival and more efficient travel, which later proved invaluable in his successful South Pole expedition. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                   Today, Gjoa Haven has a population of 1,200 and still bears the historic significance of playing a key role in polar exploration.

                                    <p>This day, in the Northwest Territories at Franklin Bay, see the spectacular “Smoking Hills,” cliffs of bituminous shale that combust and endlessly burn. This rare geological phenomenon has likely been occurring for millennia, with layers of the relatively unstable mineral jarosite covering these hills. When the mineral comes into contact with cold air, it becomes red-hot and produces a thick, black smoke — a fantastic site not unlike the smoky fumaroles produced by volcanoes.</p>

                                    <h5>HERSHEL ISLAND & THE YUKON TERRITORY</h5>
                                    <p>During a long mapping expedition in 1826, Captain Franklin was the first European to lay eyes on this unique island, at the northernmost point of the Yukon Territory. Named by Franklin, Herschel Island is a landmark in the West Arctic and has since served alternately as a whaling station, relay station and refuge for travelers. </p>
                                    <p>
                                        This morning, visit the island which teems with wildlife that includes the migrating bowhead whale, walrus, moose, musk ox, Arctic fox and 94 species of birds. It is also one of the only places on earth where you may see a grizzly bear, black bear and polar bear, the last of which live along the ice edge in summer. Evidence of the island’s whaling culture and Thule Inuit predecessors remains near the shoreline, though it may not be for much longer; the island is subject to extreme coastal erosion and scientists predict the shoreline will disappear under the waves within 50 years.

                                    <p>Typically dense with ice floes and fog, the Beaufort Sea opens up a 60-mile-wide coastal pass from August to September. Continue sailing in the comfort of your luxury expedition cruiser, participating in eye-opening lectures led by the Expedition Team. </p>
                                    <p>Be on the lookout across the sea for bowhead and beluga whales, the latter of which sustain one of the largest populations in the world here. Still hunted on a sustenance quota basis by local Inuit, the sociable creatures often travel in huge numbers and are said to be quite “chatty,” with their trills, clicks and squeals audible above the surface.‘Le Boreal’ cruises into the U.S. and clears at Point Barrow, Alaska.

After a picnic lunch continue to your camp located in the southern reaches of Serengeti National Park.<br /><br />Kusini Camp is built in and around a large kopje. The camp offers spectacular views across Tortillis woodland situated on the edge of the short grass plains. The camp is comprised of nine double tents scattered around the kopje with the mess tent and common area as the central feature. Privacy between tents is guaranteed as they are at a substantial distance from each other and are generally concealed by a tree or kopje.<br /></p>";
