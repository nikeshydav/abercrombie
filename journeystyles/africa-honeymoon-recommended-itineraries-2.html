<li><h5>Detailed Itinerary</h5>
    <h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>ARRIVE JOHANNESBURG–Chef’s table</h5>
<p>On arrival at Johannesburg, you are met by an A&K representative and privately transferred to your hotel. The boutique hotel is situated on 10 acres of beautifully landscaped gardens.</p>
<p>Explore Johannesburg’s shopping destinations at your pace which are located at a short distance from the hotel. You may also visit the Africa Craft Market of Rosebank, renowned for quality African artifacts and crafts.</p>
<p>Enjoy a chef’s table for a very special dinner experience showcasing the freshest ingredients and a creative presentation.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Saxon Boutique Hotel & Spa<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> D
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>JOHANNESBURG–MAUN–OKAVANGO DELTA–Bush walk, sundowner and a special star bath</h5>
<p>This morning you will be flown to Maun and privately connected to your camp, which is located on the banks of the Boro River in the Okavango Delta. The labyrinth of waterways, wetlands and islands is a pristine paradise for some of Africa's greatest concentration of wildlife and birdlife. You will be checked-in to an elegant African-themed suite, which is set amongst the shady trees and water delta, with a wooden deck offering sprawling views over the river and lagoon. </p>
<p>Relax in the day and freshen up by the evening for a private guided bush walk along with your armed professional guide. A bush walk is one of the few better ways to acquaint you with nature. Get close to the game and smaller beasts as you explore their habitat. </p>
<p>During your bush walk, stop over at a specially identified location for a private and a romantic sundowner in the company of your loved one.</p>
<p>On return, you will be surprised with a romantic "star bath," a freestanding traditional Botswana-style zinc bathtub set out on your private deck, surrounded by lanterns. Unwind whilst sipping some sparkling wine and enjoy the spectacular views of the shimmering waters of the Boro River under the sparkling stars. </p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Sanctuary Baines' Camp  <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B, L, D
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>OKAVANGO DELTA–Bush breakfast, philanthropic activity of interacting with semi-habituated elephants & a night game drive</h5>
<p>A bush breakfast awaits you. Take the time to sit back, enjoy the views, smells, colours and the gentle breeze. Bush breakfasts are a chance to enjoy a full breakfast in the middle of the plains, surrounded by wildlife.</p>
<p>This morning you will interact with three semi-habituated elephants of the camp - Jabu, Thembi and Morula. You will have the exclusive opportunity to observe them closely in their natural environment as they feed, take mud baths and swim, whilst learning about them and discovering their unique personalities. After a few safety tips from your mahout (trainer), you are encouraged to touch each of the elephants and lead one of them while it gently rests the tip of its trunk on your hand. You may even get a "kiss" on the cheek from one of your new friends. The elephants are fed pre-cut fodder, and you can observe them eating and playing together after their lunch.</p>
<p>At a picnic spot under large shade trees, sit down, relax and enjoy your lunch in the company of the elephants.</p>
<p>As the day draws to a close, watch the spectacular sunset across the river as you enjoy a nice drink alongside your loved one.</p>
<p>Later, you hop on an open 4x4 private vehicle for the night game drive.</p>
<p>At night, you have a chance to get close to nature - and each other - when you roll your bed onto the deck for the unique opportunity to sleep under the stars.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Sanctuary Baines' Camp  <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B, L, D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>OKAVANGO DELTA–Game drive and a mokoro excursion</h5>
<p>Enjoy an early morning game drive in a private 4X4 vehicle. Game-viewing options flourish at Baines' Camp. Resting on 260,000 acres in a private concession neighboring the famed Moremi Game Reserve, the area is superb for viewing wildlife by land in open safari vehicles. There's a good chance of seeing lions, leopard, buffalo, cheetah, giraffe, impala, zebra, wild dog, hyena and hippo that gather around the banks of Chobe River. </p>
<p>After breakfast you have time at leisure.</p>
<p>Evening you will be taken on a serene mokoro excursion. Slowly glide through the waterways of the delta in your poled mokoro (dugout canoe). You may sight some game or any other animal that may come to the bank of the river for a drink.</p>
<p>A private candle lit dinner will be served on your deck under the African stars on your return.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Sanctuary Baines' Camp <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B, L, D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day  5</h4>
<h5>OKAVANGO DELTA–MOREMI GAME RESERVE–Game drive, special sundowner and dinner</h5>
<p>After breakfast and a short game drive you will be aboard a private charter to fly to the Moremi Game Reserve. You will be assisted with check-in at Sanctuary Chief's Camp, which is situated on the previous hunting grounds of the Batawana Tribe on Chief's Island and is rated as one of the top safari destinations in Botswana by Conde Nast Traveller. The camp overlooks the seasonal Piajio Channel within the Moremi Game Reserve, an area renowned for its abundant wildlife and large variety of bird life. Sanctuary Chief's Camp is made up of 12 luxury bush pavilions - each with a spacious seating area and game-viewing deck with a hammock. </p>
<p>Afternoon, you leave on a custom-built open private vehicle for a game drive. Game viewing in Moremi is nothing short of spectacular. In addition to 400 species of birds, ostrich, antelope, crocodile, wildebeest, kudu and hippo are common here. However, the area has been dubbed the "predator capital" of Botswana, boasting of leopard, cheetah, painted wild dog, spotted hyena and a large resident pride of lion. Game drives conducted in custom-built open vehicles offer an ideal viewing.</p>
<p>Halt at a chosen vantage point for a spectacular view of the sunset. Enjoy the outstanding view of the setting sun on the horizon along with your sundowner drinks.</p>
<p>Late in the evening proceed to the bush where a private and secluded clearing has been prepared for a sophisticated dinner in the middle of the wilderness. Under the African starlit sky enjoy a delicious, warm and private candlelit dinner.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Sanctuary Baines' Camp <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B, L, D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>MOREMI GAME RESERVE–Game drive, couple spa and helicopter ride</h5>
<p>Savor a lavish English and continental breakfast as you enjoy stunning views over the floodplains. </p>
<p>Depart for a game drive and you may sight roaming lions that prey on the thousands of antelope, zebra, buffalo and also healthy populations of wild dog. Sanctuary Chief's is the ideal place to spot the big 5 - possibly even the rare rhino.</p>
<p>Post lunch you have an exclusive appointment at the mini spa for a special private romantic couple’s treatment. </p>
<p>After a revitalizing spa treatment join your private guide for a helicopter excursion to get a different perspective on the wildlife.</p>
<p>A specially prepared romantic dinner is also in store for you tonight.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Sanctuary Chobe Chilwero <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B, L, D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 7</h4>
