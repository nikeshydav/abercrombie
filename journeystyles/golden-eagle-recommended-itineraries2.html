<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 11 Days</p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong> Moscow, Kazan, Yekaterinburg, Novosibirsk,  Irkutsk, Lake Baikal, Ulan Ude, Ulaan Baatar (Mongolia), Vladivostok</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>Moscow</h5>
<p>Arrive at Moscow airport, where you are met and transferred to the luxurious five-star Marriott Royal Aurora hotel (or similar) located in the heart of this vibrant city for a one-night stay. We enjoy a welcome reception dinner at our hotel, whilst you meet your fellow travellers and anticipate the epic 15 day voyage that lies ahead.</p>

</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Moscow - Freedom of Choice Touring</h5>
<p>Our morning city tour of Moscow principally takes us to Red Square, an iconic symbol of Russia's former military and political might. Here we see an eclectic mix of fascinating architecture, such as the ornate St Basil's Cathedral with its magnificent onion-domed spires, the grandeur of The Kremlin and the sombre and evocative site of Lenin's tomb. With our Freedom of Choice touring options you may instead wish to visit, for example, the Tretyakov Gallery (National Museum of Fine Art). Early afternoon sees us boarding the luxurious Golden Eagle Trans-Siberian Express. After settling into our modern, stylish cabins, we enjoy dinner in one of the beautifully designed restaurant cars as our rail adventure eastwards to Vladivostok begins.

</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5> Kazan</h5>
<p>We arrive at the picturesque and historic city of Kazan by mid-morning. Situated on the River Volga, Kazan is the capital of Tatarstan. Here we have the opportunity to see for ourselves its rich tapestry of history and culture. One of the highlights of this city tour is our exploration of the Kremlin Fortress, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Within the walls of this ancient citadel we will explore its stunning mosque and onion-domed cathedral. After enjoying a relaxing dinner on the Golden Eagle, you may wish to retire to our welcoming bar car where you can enjoy drinks with new friends whilst listening to our resident pianist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>Yekaterinburg</h5>
<p>We cross the Europe/Asia divide before arriving in the historic city of Yekaterinburg. Founded in 1723 by Peter the Great, the third largest Russian city is also the capital of the Urals. The cultural and architectural influences of European and Asian civilisations come together in this fascinating and cosmopolitan landscape. Our city tour takes us to the poignant site where the Romanov, Nicholas II of Russia was executed with his family by the Bolsheviks in 1918. Now a church dedicated to their memory, this site provides us with a powerful insight into the turmoil of the Russian Revolution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5> Novosibirsk</h5>
<p>A modern 'Soviet' city, we experience the life and character of Novosibirsk's rich culture where the arts, science and literature predominate. Our city tour takes us to the Opera House. An architectural marvel, it houses two permanent ballet and opera companies and is the largest opera house in the world. In front of the Opera House, we visit an imposing statue of Lenin - a marvellous opportunity to have your photograph taken with this iconic political leader.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>Onboard</h5>
<p>A day to unwind and reflect on the many sights and sounds we have experienced on our journey so far. Chat to your fellow passengers, perhaps learn a few words of Russian or simply enjoy the ever changing landscape outside your window as it unfolds.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>Irkutsk</h5>
<p>We arrive in Irkutsk, the 'Paris of Siberia', and our visit today takes in the most significant sites and museums in this fascinating city, including an exploration of the classic wooden architecture that has given many of this region's buildings such a distinctive and unique appearance. Next, we visit the Decembrist House museum which is dedicated to the memory of the exiled aristocrats who were forced to flee to this remote outpost after the failed revolution of 1825. Here we enjoy a private concert before returning to our waiting train for dinner.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 8</h4>
<h5>Lake Baikal</h5>
<p>Few natural sights can surpass the beauty and grandeur of Lake Baikal. For five hours we wind our way through tunnels along cliff hugging tracks above the lake with a vista of snow capped peaks along the far shore forming a picture-perfect backdrop. Lake Baikal is the deepest lake in the world and holds 20% of the world's freshwater. Also known as the 'Pearl of Siberia' it is home to a unique breed of freshwater seal and over fifty species of fish including omul which we will be serving in the dining car for some of our meals. Weather permitting, we stop at one of Baikal's picturesque and secluded bays to enjoy a delicious BBQ including freshly smoked fish prepared by our own chefs. For the brave hearted, there is even time for a refreshing swim in the crystal clear waters. In the afternoon, we visit Listvyanka, a small Baikal settlement nestling at the base of the surrounding hills.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 9</h4>
<h5>Ulan Ude</h5>
<p>This morning we arrive in Ulan Ude, capital of the Buryat Republic. The ethnic and cultural diversity of this area offers a unique insight into its heritage. As we tour the area you will notice the different faces and dress styles of these welcoming people. During our exploration of the Old Believers Village we have the opportunity to learn about the culture and history of these religious people as we are treated to a traditional meal and enjoy a concert featuring local dancers and musicians.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 10</h4>
<h5>Ulaan Baatar, Mongolia</h5>
<p>Our Trans-Siberian adventure takes us onto Ulaan Baatar, the capital of Mongolia. Passing the central monument to Genghis Khan, undoubtedly the most feared and revered Mongol, we visit the National Museum where we explore the country's intriguing history. Lunch is taken Mongol style in a traditional Ger (Yurt) where we experience an authentic meal, enjoying excellent local dishes and entertainment providing a unique opportunity to encounter this time-honoured nomadic way of life. You are free to spend your afternoon shopping for traditional Mongolian gifts or there is an option to drive through Gorkhi-Terelj National Park. For your final evening you will be transferred to your hotel in Ulan Baatar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 11</h4>
<h5>Ulan Baatar, Monglia</h5>
<p>Following breakfast, you will be transferred to Ulan Baatar airport to begin your journey home.</p>
</li>

<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 15 Days</p>
<p>Moscow, Vladimir, Suzdal, Yekaterinburg, Novosibirsk, Irkutsk, Lake Baikal, Ulan Ude, Ulaan Baatar, (Mongolia), Vladivostok </p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1-2</h4>
<h5>Moscow with Freedom of Choice Touring</h5>
<p>Arrive at Moscow airport, where you are met and transferred to the five-star Marriott Royal Aurora hotel (or similar) located in the heart of the city for a one-night stay. We enjoy a welcome reception dinner at our hotel.
The following morning our tour of Moscow takes us to Red Square, an iconic symbol of Russia's former military and political might. Here we see a mix of fascinating architecture, such as St Basil's Cathedral with its magnificent onion-domed spires, the grandeur of The Kremlin and the evocative site of Lenin's tomb. With our Freedom of Choice touring options you may wish instead to visit, for example, the Tretyakov Gallery (National Museum of Fine Art). We enjoy the sophistication of a Moscow evening as we take dinner in one of the city's many restaurants. Late evening sees us board the Golden Eagle Trans-Siberian Express.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>Vladimir and Suzdal</h5>
<p>Today we visit the historic city of Vladimir. Founded in 990, it is one of the Russia's oldest communities with an architectural wealth and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Our tour takes in Uspensky Cathedral, built between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries. It is considered one of the most important and beautiful of Russian cathedrals, where many of the prominent Russian Tsars were crowned. Our excursion moves on to the town of Suzdal, one of Russia's most perfectly preserved walled cities dating back to 1024. Here we visit the atmospheric St Euthymius Monastery to witness an enchanting choral performance by a male choir. No Russian winter experience would be complete without a Troika Sledge Ride. Enjoy the stunning scenery as your open horse drawn sleigh takes you on a captivating journey around Suzdal.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>Yekaterinburg</h5>
<p>We cross the Europe/Asia divide before arriving in the historic city of Yekaterinburg. Founded in 1723 by Peter the Great, this third largest Russian city is also the capital of the Urals. Our tour takes us to the execution site where the Romanov, Nicholas II of Russia was executed with his family by the Bolsheviks in 1918. Now a church dedicated to their memory, this site offers a powerful insight into the turmoil of the Russian Revolution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>

</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>Onboard</h5>

</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>Irkutsk</h5>
<p>We arrive in Irkutsk, the 'Paris of Siberia', and take in the most significant sites and museums in this city, including an exploration of the classic wooden architecture that has given many of this region's buildings such a distinctive and unique appearance. Next, we visit the Decembrist House museum which is dedicated to the memory of the exiled aristocrats who were forced to flee to this remote outpost after the failed revolution of 1825. We will enjoy a private concert before leaving for the enchanting wooded encampment of Zaimka (Hunters Lodge) where we will be met by local women dressed in traditional costume. We have the opportunity to explore a Banya (Russian Sauna) in one of the region's authentic wooden houses. Drinks and traditional food can be enjoyed within a series of the cosy timber houses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 8</h4>
<h5>Lake Baikal</h5>
<p>Today offers a real highlight of travelling through Siberia in winter. Few natural sights can surpass the beauty and grandeur of Lake Baikal. For five hours we wind our way through tunnels along cliff hugging tracks above the frozen lake with snow-capped peaks along the far shore forming a picture-perfect backdrop. Completely frozen in winter Lake Baikal is the deepest lake in the world and at this time of year we will visit the shoreside Ice Festival to look at the many intricate works of ice art. We are taken in a hovercraft across the lake for 30 minutes to the place where the ice fishing, dog sledges and snowmobiles are situated and you will enjoy the perfect vantage point to appreciate the magnificence of this unspoilt location. There is also the opportunity to watch the under-ice fishing and try the freshly caught fish which have been smoked in a mobile smokehouse and served warm with ice-cold vodka. Delicious! This is truly a unique day of activities and adventure to experience!</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 9</h4>
<h5>Ulan Ude</h5>
<p>Today we arrive in Ulan Ude, capital of the Buryat Republic. The ethnic and cultural diversity of this area offers a unique insight into its heritage. As we tour the area you will notice the different faces and dress styles of these welcoming people. During our exploration of the Old Believer's Village we have the opportunity to learn about the culture and history of these religious people as we are treated to a traditional meal and enjoy a concert featuring local dancers and musicians.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 10</h4>
<h5>Ulaan Baatar, Mongolia</h5>
<p>Our Trans-Siberian adventure takes us to Ulaan Baatar, the capital of Mongolia. Passing the central monument to Genghis Khan, undoubtedly the most feared and infamous Mongol, we also visit the National Museum where we explore the country's intriguing history. Lunch is taken Mongol style in a traditional Ger (Yurt) where we experience an authentic local meal and entertainment providing a unique opportunity to encounter this time-honoured nomadic way of life.
</p>
</li>

<p>Enjoy a more leisurely pace today as we travel through the beautiful Russian landscape of this vast and varied country.
</p>

Tonight, we enjoy our last dinner onboard as we approach our final destination on this unforgettable journey.
</p>
</li>

<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>Ulan Ude</h5>
<p>Today we arrive in Ulan Ude, capital of the Buryat Republic. The ethnic and cultural diversity of this area offers a unique insight into its Mongol heritage. As we tour the area you will notice the different faces and dress styles of these welcoming people. During the exploration of the Old Believer's Village we have the opportunity to learn about the culture and history of these communities as we are treated to a traditional meal and enjoy a concert featuring local dancers and musicians.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 8</h4>
<h5>Lake Baikal</h5>
<p>Today offers a real highlight of travelling through Siberia in winter. Few natural sights can surpass the beauty and grandeur of Lake Baikal. For five hours we wind our way through tunnels along cliff hugging tracks above the frozen lake with snow-capped peaks along the far shore forming a picture-perfect backdrop. Completely frozen in winter Lake Baikal is the deepest lake in the world and at this time of year we will visit the shoreside Ice Festival to look at the many intricate works of ice art. We are taken in a hovercraft across the lake for 30 minutes to the place where the ice fishing, dog sledges and snowmobiles are situated and you will enjoy the perfect vantage point to appreciate the magnificence of this unspoilt location. There is also the opportunity to watch the under-ice fishing and try the freshly caught fish which have been smoked in a mobile smokehouse and served warm with ice-cold vodka. Delicious! This is truly a unique day of activities and adventure to experience!</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 9</h4>
<h5>Irkutsk</h5>
<p>We arrive in Irkutsk, the 'Paris of Siberia', and take in the most significant sites and museums in this city, including an exploration of the classic wooden architecture that has given many of this region's buildings such a distinctive and unique appearance. Next, we visit the Decembrist House museum which is dedicated to the memory of the exiled aristocrats who were forced to flee to this remote outpost after the failed revolution of 1825. We will enjoy a private concert before leaving for the enchanting wooded encampment of Zaimka (Hunters Lodge) where we will be met by local women dressed in traditional costume. We have the opportunity to explore a Banya (Russian Sauna) in one of the region's authentic wooden houses. Drinks and traditional food can be enjoyed within a series of the cosy timber houses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 10</h4>
<h5>Onboard</h5>
<p>Today we relax onboard as our train travels through the Sayan Mountains. In comfort enjoy the ever changing views as sweeping panoramas of natural beauty unfold before us. Time and weather permitting, we may stop at Abakan located at the confluence of the Yenisei and Abakan rivers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 11</h4>
<h5>Novosibirsk</h5>
<p>A modern 'Soviet' city, we experience the life and character of Novosibirsk's rich cultural city. Our tour takes us to the Novosibirsk Opera House. An architectural marvel, it houses two permanent ballet and opera companies and is the largest opera house in the world. In front of the Opera House, we visit an imposing statue of Lenin - a marvellous opportunity to have your photograph taken with this iconic political leader.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 12</h4>
<h5>Yekaterinburg</h5>
<p>Founded in 1723 by Peter the Great, Yekaterinburg is Russia's third largest city and is also the capital of the Urals. The cultural and architectural influences of European and Asian civilisations fuse in this cosmopolitan landscape, making it a unique experience. Our tour takes us to the execution site where Tsar Nicholas II was executed by the Bolsheviks in 1918. Now a church dedicated to their memory, this site offers a powerful insight into the turmoil of the Russian Revolution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 13</h4>
<h5>Vladimir and Suzdal</h5>
<p>Today we visit the historic city of Vladimir. Founded in 990, it is one of the Russia's oldest communities with an architectural wealth and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Our tour takes in Uspensky Cathedral, built between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries. It is considered one of the most important and beautiful of Russian cathedrals, where many of the prominent Russian Tsars were crowned. Our excursion moves on to the pastoral town of Suzdal, one of Russia's most perfectly preserved walled cities dating back to 1024. Here we visit the atmospheric St Euthymius Monastery to witness an enchanting choral performance by the resident monks. No Russian winter experience would be complete without a Troika Sledge Ride. Enjoy the stunning scenery as your open horse drawn sleigh takes you on a captivating journey around Suzdal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 14-15</h4>
<h5>Moscow with Freedom of Choice Touring</h5>
<p>After travelling along this epic route to the end of the Trans-Siberian line, we arrive into Moscow mid-morning. Our city tour of Moscow principally takes us to Red Square. Here we see a mix of fascinating architecture, such as St Basil's Cathedral with its magnificent onion-domed spires and the sombre and evocative site of Lenin's tomb. With our Freedom of Choice touring options you may wish to visit, for example, the Tretyakov Gallery (National Museum of Russian Fine Art). At the conclusion of our city tour, we transfer to the five-star Marriott Royal Aurora hotel (or similar). Our final evening is spent saying our goodbyes to our travelling companions at the Farewell Dinner. The following morning you will be transferred to Moscow airport to begin your journey home.</p>
