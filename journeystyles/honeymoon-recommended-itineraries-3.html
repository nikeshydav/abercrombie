        <h5>BERLIN</h5>
        <p>Today enjoy a full day with a guide and driver (8 hours) on a food & art tour of Berlin. Start with a visit to the Turkish market in Kreuzberg on the banks of the canal (Tuesday + Friday only).</p>

KaDeWe has a mouthwatering food court on the 6th floor with a selection of food and drink to rival Harrods in London. During your tour your guide will treat you to some delicious snacks along the way, such as a traditional Berlin currywurst (the best of these are found in Kreuzberg apparently), Berliner Weiße (beer with red or green syrup) as well as some patisserie or petit four from kadewe.</p>
        <p>This afternoon you may like to pay a visit to Tacheles, a wacky, colourful artists residence which houses a number of quirky modern works of art. The building is a former department store in the Jewish quarter (Scheunenviertel) of Berlin. It served as a Nazi prison during the Second World War and recently it was taken over by artists who called it Tacheles which is Yiddish for "straight talking." The building is a popular place for visitors, however the lease with the property owner expired at the end of 2008 and the future of the art house is now uncertain.</p>
        <p>Finally, visit the 'Hackesche Höfe,' one of the most famous and attractive of Berlin's interconnecting courtyards in the Mitte district. Formerly a rather neglected area, Hackescher Markt has developed into a cultural and commercial centre since the German reunification and has become famous for its nightlife.

Rhinos can be seen with calves at heel. Eland and waterbuck appear not to notice the human visitors, enabling photographers to shoot at ease.

                                <p>On Arrival at Istanbul, where you are met and provided VIP service through customs and immigration allowing a seamless arrival. Istanbul, at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, is a fascinating city, whose rich Byzantine and Ottoman history and culture combine with modern day bustle to create a metropolis that offers something for every interest. Your beautifully landscaped hotel is set on the banks of the Bosphorus; inside, find a state-of-the-art urban spa with an indoor pool and Turkish bath that offer wonderful opportunities for spending time together. Open-air venues - including an outdoor pool - face views of the city's magical monuments and the natural beauty of the sea.</p>

                                <p>Explore some of Istanbul's masterpieces of Byzantine and Ottoman architecture, beginning with the sixth-century Basilica Cistern. With its great acoustics, the structure today hosts classical music concerts. Visit the timeless Hagia Sophia, one of the greatest surviving examples of Byzantine architecture. Originally built as a church in 360, it has been a museum since 1935. The Turks ruled most of the Mediterranean and western Orient from the 15th-century Topkapi Palace. See it today, and then continue to the Pera district, the present-day heart of Istanbul. Early this evening, share special moments on a private sunset cruise of the Bosphorus. As you sail along, watch the beautiful skyline with its splendid mansions, Judas blossoms, forts and palaces.</p>

                                <p>The 16th century was the Golden Age of the Ottoman Empire, and the era's master architect was Sinan. Visit his Suleymaniye Mosque, dominating the skyline with its imposing dome. In the Ottoman world, pious mosque-school-bathhouse complexes sustained the social life of the community, and fabulous markets and bazaars powered the economic life. Visit Sinan's wonderful Rustem Pasa Mosque, known for its Iznik tiles. It is located next to the busy Spice Bazaar. Perhaps you can find a souvenir or two in its 88 vaulted rooms. After wandering through the bazaar, stop for a treat: a taste of Istanbul's best baklava and the opportunity to meet the master pastry chef. No mall is as dazzling as the 3,500-stall Grand Covered Bazaar, and you have a chance to walk through it looking for your own treasures. In the early evening, take the public ferry across the Bosphorus to Kadikoy's extensive public markets on the Asian side, watching the sun as it sets behind the magical domes and minarets. Stroll hand in hand through the markets to Ciya Restaurant, where you dine on exquisite traditional delicacies.</p>

                                <p>Fly to Izmir, the birthplace of Homer, and visit the remains of the great Ionian city of Ephesus, lying at the foot of Mount Pion. Unmatched as an archaeological site, the sheer size and grandeur of the ruins make this the best-preserved classical city in the eastern Mediterranean. Wander the archaeological park, the local museum and temple, and attend a private opening of the breathtaking Terrace Houses. For lunch, join a local family in their country restaurant for a hands-on lesson in Turkish cooking. Afterward, head to the beautifully preserved village of Sirince, resting on a curved gorge that overlooks endless olive groves reaching toward the Aegean Sea. Spend your night in an authentic cottage with wonderful views over the town, valley and surrounding mountains. Return to Ephesus this evening for an incredible opportunity and poignant event: an opportunity to renew your marriage vows in front of the Celsus Library. Officiated by a local priest and accompanied by the Izmir State Symphony, your wedding blessing becomes a powerful memory to cherish for a lifetime.</p>

                                <p>Millennia-long volcanic activity and erosion turned the volcanic remains into a soft porous stone named tuff, creating a unique landscape in Cappadocia. The valleys of tuff filled with "fairy chimneys" became cave dwellings, monasteries, chapels and cellar villages at the hands of expert carvers. Fly to Cappadocia where you can explore this magical fairyland, marveling at the fascinating rock-carved churches and subterranean settlements. For lunch, travel by horse cart to a quiet place in the country for a picnic barbecue. Feast on a meze (an array of small plates) of salads, kebabs, fried chicken and lamb chops. Afterward, check in to your deluxe traditional Cappadocia hotel, partly carved into the tuff. Admire the antiques, elegant furniture, handmade wool and silk carpets used in the décor throughout the property. Then explore the rock-carved churches of Göreme, now an open-air museum displaying fine examples of ninth- and tenth-century Byzantine wall paintings. Later, privately visit the beautifully restored Dark Church and view its 11th-century frescoes before going on a hike in the famous Red Valley.</p>

                                <p>Wake with the sunrise and embark on a thrilling hot-air balloon ride over Cappadocia, looking down over the magical landscapes. When you return to land, celebrate with a champagne toast. After a late breakfast, explore another marvel of the region: the "underground city" at Kaymakli. The extensive network of rock-carved subterranean tunnels and hallways, storage and sleeping cells, airshafts and chapels, is more than 140 feet deep. With your guide, follow a lighted route and descend to 70 feet to view the mysterious passageways and dwellings. Then join a local farmer and his family for lunch in their home. This afternoon, visit Göreme Village Weavers Association, where young girls weave traditional rugs at home.</p>

This 19th-century Kasbah will leave even the most committed sybarite overwhelmed. Dar Ahlams luxury is all the more striking against the backdrop of the Sahara. It’s a universe whose refined decoration is a subtle mixture of tastes and styles, in which light gives the aura of a museum, where space and quietude are the most dominant characteristics. The property stands in an oasis that once formed part of a medieval sultan’s private hunting ground. Within the walls of the kasbah are eight suites, and three private villas stand in the grounds.</p>
