Established in 1951, and covering an area of almost 15,000 sq km, an area comparable to the state of Connecticut or Northern Ireland, the Serengeti hosts a fantastically diverse ecosystem. The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, where 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other plains game that follow close behind, make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";

Transfer from Arusha to Ngorongoro Crater Lodge located on the rim with spectacular views across the crater. The Ngorongoro Crater is the largest unbroken caldera in the world and the first sight of it is breathtaking.<br /><br />Ngorongoro Crater Lodge is situated on the edge of the ancient crater rim above the cool, swirling mists. The lodge is a return to the noble elegance of the travelling colonials. Inspired in design by the Maasai Manyatta, three separate camps of 6 to 12 suites each remember a bygone era when characters such as Lord Delamere adorned the stilted, handcrafted structures with graceful antiques, grand chandeliers and treasures collected from travels through Africa.<br /><br /></p>";

Rhinos can often be seen with calves at heel. Eland and waterbuck appear not to notice the human visitors, enabling photographers to shoot at ease. On the lake in the middle of the crater you may see thousands of flamingos fluttering and shimmering like a pink heat haze. Zebra and wildebeest account for almost half the animals.

You will then be privately transferred to your hotel and be assisted with check-in. En route to your hotel drive by the periphery of the world’s most striking city walls. Constructed between 413 and 447 by Theodosius II, they were the greatest fortifications built up to their time, stretching more than four miles from the Golden Horn in the north to the Sea of Marmara in the south. Four Seasons, Bosphorus is a palace beautifully modified into a chic retreat, stunningly landscaped & surrounded by the azure waters and the mountain tops. </p>
<p>Day at leisure</p>
<p>Dinner reservations can be made at Maiden’s (or Leander’s) Tower, where you may enjoy drinks and dinner on the first-floor restaurant or the café, Kiz Kulesi. Dinner could be followed by some wine with your loved one on the top floor of this light house with awe inspiring views against the dark at the Kuledebar. Rising up on an islet in the middle of the Bosphorus, this former Ottoman lighthouse has inspired not one, but two legends. We strongly recommend a visit for truly romantic experience.</p>

Cuddle up with your sweetheart in a horse-drawn buggy (private vehicles are not permitted on the island). Or stroll along the leafy boulevards lined with Ottoman-Victorian colonial houses. Enjoy a glass of wine at the café on the grounds of the famous St. George’s Church.</p>
<p>After lunch, you will be taken on a private guided half day sightseeing tour (4 hour) with your A&K Representative. The 16th century was the Golden Age of the Ottoman Empire, and the era's master architect was Sinan. Visit his Suleymaniye Mosque, dominating the skyline with its magnificent dome. In the Ottoman world, pious mosque-school-bathhouse complexes sustained the social life of the community, and magnificent markets and bazaars powered the financial life. Visit Sinan's splendid Rustem Pasa Mosque, well-known for its Iznik tiles, located close to the eventful Spice Bazaar. Perhaps you can locate a souvenir or two in its 88 vaulted rooms. After strolling around the bazaar, stop for a special treat, taste of Istanbul's best baklava and the chance to meet the master pastry chef. No mall is as alluring as the 3,500-stall Grand Covered Bazaar, and you have an opportunity to walk through it looking for your own treasures. </p>
<p>This evening, you could venture out to enjoy the famed nightlife of Istanbul.</p>

<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>ISTANBUL–IZMIR–EPHESUS–SIRINCE–Sightseeing, local cooking & renew your vows</h5>
<p>Fly to Izmir, the birthplace of Homer, and visit the remains of the great Ionian city of Ephesus, lying at the foot of Mount Pion. Unequaled as an archaeological site, the absolute size and grandeur of the ruins make it the best-preserved classical city in the eastern Mediterranean. Wander around the archaeological park, local museum and temple, and attend a private opening of the breathtaking Terrace Houses. </p>
<p>For lunch, join a local family in their country restaurant for a hands-on lesson in Turkish cooking. </p>
<p>Move ahead to the beautifully preserved village of Sirince, resting on a curved gorge that overlooks never-ending olive groves extending towards the Aegean Sea. Spend your night in an authentic cottage with brilliant views over the town, valley and surrounding mountains. </p>
<p>Return to Ephesus in the evening for a delightful opportunity and poignant event: a chance to renew your marriage vows in front of the Celsus Library.

<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5> SIRINCE–IZMIR–CAPPADOCIA–Picnic lunch & romantic dinner</h5>
<p>Your private chauffer will drive you to the airport in Izmir for your private charter flight to Cappadocia. Millennia-long volcanic activity and erosion turned the volcanic remains into a soft porous stone named tuff, which form the stunning landscape of Cappadocia. The valleys of tuff occupied with "fairy chimneys" were developed by expert carvers into cave dwellings, monasteries, chapels and cellar villages. </p>
<p>On arrival, you would be met & assisted to your luxurious traditional Cappadocia hotel, which is also partly carved into the tuff. Appreciate the antiques, elegant furniture, handmade wool and silk carpets that form a part of the interior décor throughout the property. </p>
<p>At your own pace sightsee the rock-carved churches of Göreme, now an open-air museum displaying fine examples of ninth- and tenth-century Byzantine wall paintings. </p>
<p>Lunch, ride by horse cart to a quaint place in the country for a picnic barbecue. Feast on a mezze of salads, kebabs, fried chicken and lamb chops.</p>
<p>We suggest a romantic dinner at Sur Balık Restaurant, which offers new tastes in Cappadocia. Talented executive chefs concoct the Anatolian specialties beside the famous Red River of Avanos. </p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> The Museum Hotel <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>

<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>CAPPADOCIA–Hot air ballooning</h5>
<p>Wake with sunrise and get on board for a thrilling hot-air balloon ride over Cappadocia, looking down over the magical landscapes. When you land, celebrate with a champagne toast. After a late breakfast, explore another wonder of the region: the "underground city" at Kaymakli. The wide network of rock-carved subterranean tunnels and hallways, storage and sleeping cells, airshafts and chapels, is more than 140 feet deep. With your private guide, follow a lighted route and descend to 70 feet to explore the mysterious passageways and dwellings. </p>
<p>Lunch; join a local farmer and his family at their home for a taste of authentic and rustic cuisine. </p>
<p>This afternoon, visit Göreme Village Weavers Association, where young girls weave traditional rugs at home. </p>
<p>Or<br>
Evening, you can experience a special private massage session in one of the hidden and mystic valleys as part of our Valley Experiences. At offer are a variety of exclusive massages, such as our Ehl-i Massage, Cariye's Secret, Asian Silence, Sultan's Pleasure, Secret of Aphrodite, and Cappadocian Roses from menus (placed in your room)—all carried out with a professional and personal touch.

The Serengeti perhaps defines the safari experience as surely as the wildlife that inhabits it. Established in 1951, and covering an area of almost 15,000 sq km, an area comparable to the state of Connecticut or Northern Ireland, the Serengeti hosts a fantastically diverse ecosystem. The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, where 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other plains game that follow close behind, make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";
