<p>Buenos Aires is the birthplace of Tango, born in the brothels of the city, just before the beginning of the 1880s century. The word' Tango" refers to both a musical style and the dance performed to it. Tango, a dance known as passionate, sensual and very elegant, was all the rage in the 1930's in Buenos Aries and Paris. Tango is not only a dance but also an obsession. For the ´tanguero´, it is as much as a part of life as eating and sleeping. Erotic and passionate, haunting and melancholic, it involves not only the body but also the soul. Yes, it is just feeling - but in one dance, you can express sad, happy, angry, relax, deep, shallow, cheerful, sorrow, painful, serious, intellectual or just playful feelings. Tango has captured the popular imagination for over one hundred years to become no less than an international cult.</p>

<p>Board the deluxe Hiram Bingham train, the most luxurious way to travel the breathtaking landscape to Machu Picchu. Step on board, and you are immersed in an elegant world of polished wood, gleaming cutlery and glittering glass that evokes a romantic ambience. After a light lunch on board, arrive at the breathtaking Incan citadel and begin exploring the ruins in the company of your expert guide. Feel the pulse of this magical place as you visualize the lives of the priests, craftsmen, and servants who inhabited this seemingly uninhabitable citadel and then left, leaving no written records about its destruction. After a busy day of sightseeing, return to your beautiful mountainside retreat, high in the lush Andean clouds forest. It features the look and feel of a rural Andean village set in spectacular grounds with paths that wind past waterfalls and gardens, and trails that wander through wild forest. Snuggle under a thick alpaca blanket in your suite, which offers incredible views of the exotic gardens or the dramatic Vilcanota River.

</li>
<h5>ITINERARY</h5>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>Arrive Nairobi – Fly to Lewa Downs</h5>
<p>On arrival at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi you will be met by an A&K representative and after clearing customs you will be transferred to Wilson Airport about 15 kilometres away for your scheduled flight to Lewa Downs.</p>
<p>A guide will meet you on arrival and transfer you to the camp. Enjoy a game drive en-route to the camp; you may be rewarded with sightings of lion, elephant and plenty of plains game.</p>
<p>Lewa Safari Camp comprises twelve luxury tents on Lewa Wildlife Conservancy. Lewa is famed the world over for its community conservation efforts and the fruits of those efforts are visible in the vast quantities of game that live on the 65,000 acre farm. Rarities like rhino and the splay-footed sitatunga antelope are easy to see at Lewa, as are more common elephant, lion and leopard.</p>
<p>Once at the camp, you will be met by your hosts with a beverage at hand after which you will be escorted to your luxurious tent that consists of a main bedroom, an en-suite bathroom and a private veranda from which you can enjoy views of the landscape and Mt Kenya in the distance.</p>
<p>After lunch, you have time for a relaxing swim or a nap, followed by your first game drive in a private vehicle booked just for you. Game driving in Lewa is outstanding - Lewa is home to 10 per cent of Kenya’s black rhino population and the single largest population of Grevy’s zebra in the world. </p>
<p>You will return to camp for a romantic candle lit dinner served by the fireplace in the main lounge.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight Stay:</strong> Lewa Safari Camp</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Lewa Downs</h5>
<p>Start the second day of your special honeymoon with a wakeup call followed by a private breakfast served on your tent deck. Mornings at Lewa are always special; often you can enjoy spectacular views of a snow-capped Mt Kenya in the distance.</p>
<p>Today you have the chance to explore Lewa by spending a full day at the conservancy in a variety of ways. You can choose to go on a guided bush walk - there are few better ways to experience nature. Get close to the plains game through an evening horse or camel ride in the picturesque conservancy.</p>
<p>Lewa Downs are in the heart of the Laikipia region, a broad swathe of lava plateau that reaches the foothills of Mount Kenya on one side and in contrast, the wild deserts of the Northern Frontier District on the other. Outside of the Maasai Mara, Laikipia can boast the greatest wildlife experiences in Kenya.</p>
<p>Lewa Downs is probably East Africa’s finest conservancy and has been the home of the Craig family since the 1920’s. Delia, the grandmother, was awarded it in a post war colonial land lottery. She had qualified to enter the land hand out through her services as a nurse in the trenches. With a handsome chunk of Kenya to her name, she was soon married to David and they ran the area as a cattle ranch up in to the late 1980’s. </p>
<p>At this time and with the support of various benefactors, Royal and otherwise, they decided to concentrate on the conservation of game and are now one of the country’s great success stories. Having originally hunted out the rhino themselves, they now have over sixty, both black and white, on their property. They also have a thriving predator population and a plethora of plains game and smaller beasts.</p>
<p>After a long day in the bush, indulge in a massage at the spa, a wonderful way to ease the fatigue out of tired shoulders and back. Compliment those tanned limbs with a manicure and a pedicure!</p>
<p>Later enjoy a private romantic dinner served by the pool side, as you watch the sun set over the horizon.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight Stay:</strong> Lewa Safari Camp</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>Lewa Downs</h5>
<p>Today on your last day in Lewa, breakfast will be served in the bush. Take the time to sit back, enjoy the spectacular views, the smells, colours and the gentle breeze. Bush breakfasts are a chance to enjoy a full breakfast in the middle of the plains, surrounded by wildlife</p>
<p>On your final day you have the chance to interact with your hosts – the Samburu people. Lewa Conservancy borders the Samburu community living in bordering conservancies in the arid lowlands of the north. The Samburu whose name means butterfly are one of the few remaining communities who still practice their traditional culture despite the fast changing world. You have the opportunity to visit a local Samburu village, where you can learn about the culture and also buy hand-crafted beadwork and carvings offered for sale. Remember to bargain!</p>
<p>As the day draws to a close, your guide will drive you into the bush where a private and secluded vantage point where a sundowner has been prepared. Stop, watch the spectacular sunset as you enjoy the gin and tonic in your hand.</p>
<p>Later drive back to the camp where a sumptuous dinner will be laid out on your tent verandah.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight Stay:</strong> Lewa Safari Camp</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>Lewa Downs //Masai Mara</h5>
<p>After breakfast this morning, you will be transferred to the airstrip for your scheduled flight to 
Maasai Mara’s Kichwa Tembo airstrip.</p>
<p>As you approach the Maasai Mara the beauty of the wilderness and the freshness of air that comes with it are sure to take your breath away. In this vast wilderness, culture mingles easily with the wild and the Mara is home to not only the Maasai people but also the numerous games that include the Big Five.</p>
<p>A flower girl and your Sanctuary Olonana guide will meet you on arrival and transfer you to the camp. En-route enjoy a first glimpse of the Maasai Mara’s wildlife, you may be rewarded with sightings of elephant, buffalo, giraffe and a host of plain game.</p>
<p>On arrival at Sanctuary Olonana you will be met by your host with scented towels and a glass of nice welcome juice or iced tea as you are shown to your spacious tent that has floor to ceiling mosquito netting, en suite bathroom, solar lighting and large river view veranda. In your room you find a bottle of sparkling wine, fruits and flowers.</p>
<p>After lunch there is time for a relaxing swim or a nap, followed by your first afternoon game drive. The Maasai Mara is a fabulous place for seeing big cats and all of the big five, a variety of plains game and over 300 species of birds. The plains offer a rich variety of food for the dominant wildebeest and Topi, eland and buffalo, Thompson’s and Grant’s gazelle. In the Mara River, hippos submerge to snort and grumble while crocodiles sunbathe, mouths agape, on the riverbanks. Around July to October, the Mara plays host to the greatest show on earth – the wildebeest migration. </p>
<p>You will return to camp for a private candle lit dinner served on your deck under the African stars.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight Stay:</strong> Sanctuary Olonana</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>Maasai Mara </h5>
<p>Start another day of your special safari holiday with a wakeup call and steaming coffee or tea as you watch the rising of the African sun, listen to the sounds of the cascading river before you, the singing of birds and the hippos snorting in the river. Then take in the fresh morning air as you walk to the main camp for breakfast. After a nice sumptuous breakfast it is time for your second extended game drive that will bring you back for lunch.</p>
<p>Today you can choose to walk with our naturalist and learn about plants, trees, insects and even how to approach animals on foot, as your guide shows you how to spot animal signs which are everywhere but not that easily noticed. </p>
<p>During your stay there are a variety of activities that can be booked on request. These include a balloon safari. Imagine floating gently over the plains with a bird’s eye view of the game below as the sun rises slowly over the horizon. After around one hour the balloon lands and nearby a full breakfast is served in the middle of the bush with glasses of bubbly to toast your flight!</p>
<p>Another activity available is an adventure on Lake Victoria. Take an early flight by light aircraft to the lake. Try fishing for the legendary giant Nile perch found in these waters as you explore the myriad of tiny islands or stop at a traditional fishing village and see how the villagers live from day to day before flying back to the Maasai Mara.</p>
<p>Return for lunch.</p>
<p>There is time to relax after lunch before your three hour appointment in our mini spa which offers a range of treatments from facials to body massages. <br>
After an invigorating spa treatment join your guide for a short game drive before driving to a specially chosen vantage point overlooking the Mara plains.  Enjoy sundowner drinks as you take in the beauty of the rapid sunset colouring the acacia dotted plains and transforming the world in a matter of minutes.  Sit by a log fire and discuss the day's adventures as waiters serve canapés, with the spectacular setting sun on the horizon. 
</p>
<p>Return to camp for a candle lit dinner by your deck. </p>
<p><strong>Overnight Stay:</strong> Sanctuary Olonana </p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>Maasai Mara</h5> 
<p>This morning after breakfast venture out with your expert guide to explore the Mara on a full day game drive.</p>
<p>Experience a special “Out of Africa” picnic in homage to that magical scene in the film with Meryl Streep, Robert Redford and that wonderful gramophone. Sanctuary Olonana is located in almost exactly the same spot where the Maasai Mara scenes in “Out of Africa” were filmed. Out in the bush on a rise of the escarpment, we recreate a memorable traditional British picnic tea whilst overlooking some of the most spectacular, game-filled scenery on the continent.</p>
<p>Return to camp later in the afternoon. There is time relax by the pool or in your tent.</p>
<p>On your last evening in the Maasai Mara, you will be picked up by your guide and driven into the bush where a private and secluded clearing has been prepared for an elegant dinner in the middle of the wilderness. The table setting is as sophisticated and elegant as those found in the finest restaurants. Candles flicker in the darkness, throwing golden lights on the tablecloth as smiling waiters serve a delicious dinner. After dinner retire to the warmth of the campfire with a brandy or other liqueur of your choice to relax and absorb the peace and beauty of an African night.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight Stay:</strong> Sanctuary Olonana</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>Maasai Mara// Diani Beach </h5>
<p>After a sumptuous breakfast at Sanctuary Olonana, bid the staff farewell and depart for Kichwa 
Tembo airstrip for your scheduled flight to Diani Beach in Kenya’s South coast.
</p>
<p>You will be met by a guide and transferred to Kinondo Kwetu, your abode for this last leg of 
your honeymoon.
</p>
<p>Kinondo Kwetu is a collection of five houses on Galu Beach south of Mombasa. Run by a Swedish family, it boasts what must be the only sauna on the Kenyan coast! Surprisingly pleasant even at the high temperatures found here, saunas are just one of the myriad activities offered at Kinondo Kwetu – from scuba diving to horseback riding.

Established in 1951, and covering an area of almost 15,000 sq km, an area comparable to the state of Connecticut or Northern Ireland, the Serengeti hosts a fantastically diverse ecosystem. The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, where 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other plains game that follow close behind, make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";
