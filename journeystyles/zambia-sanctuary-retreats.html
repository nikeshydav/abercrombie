<h3>Sanctuary Puku Ridge</h3>
<p>Sanctuary Puku Ridge is an intimate camp with seven tents. Named after the Puku antelope that grazes on the floodplains below, this traditional safari camp is perched on an escarpment in a remote part of the South Luangwa National Park.</p>
<p>This camp offers guests an authentic tented safari holiday in Zambia. The South Luangwa is one of the country's best areas for game viewing and bird spotting. The region is home to some 60 mammals - including elephant, lion, wild dog, buffalo, hippo and, of course, antelope - as well as over 400 bird species.</p>
<p>Spend an afternoon relaxing in the camp's large living area in between thrilling game drives or walking safaris. You might even hear the Puku antelope whistling to one another when danger threatens. The central dining area produces gourmet meals despite its remoteness. Sanctuary Puku Ridge Camp is designed to leave no trace on the environment and has embraced a very natural kind of African chic in its decor.</p>
<p>The seven tents are spacious and comfortable, each with a soothing hot tub and an outdoor shower shaded by trees and stocked with luscious and environmentally friendly Africology products. Watch the sun rise from your double bed, or spot animals making their way across the plains to a waterhole from your private viewing deck.</p>
<p>Activities include: day and night game drives by open 4WD safari vehicles and walking safaris.

<h3>Sanctuary Chichele Presidential Lodge:</h3>
<p>This historic hilltop lodge with just ten suites is found in Zambia's vast South Luangwa National Park. Home to probably the highest concentration of hippos in the world, as well as lions, leopards and elephants, South Luangwa is famous for its walking safaris.</p>
<p>
Sanctuary Chichele was originally built for Kenneth Kaunda, the former Zambian President, in the 1970s and the original colonial style has been retained in the furnishings. A long veranda stretches outside the dining room, from which guests are afforded views down the valley to the Luangwa itself. When possible, dinner is served outside. On cooler nights, roaring fires take the chill out of the air. The roar of lions or the saw of leopards can often be heard from the wooded valleys that surround the lodge.</p>
<p>
Each of the ten elegant suites at Sanctuary Chichele boast four-poster beds, air conditioning and a private veranda. In keeping with the rest of Chichele, the suites are decorated in an understated colonial style with a fully appointed en suite bathroom. Large French windows offer a light, airy feel to the suites, opening onto private terraces - the ideal vantage point to relax and enjoy the wildlife.</p>
<p>Children of all ages are welcome at the lodge making it an excellent family safari choice. A swimming pool is a welcome distraction during the heat of the day.</p>
<p>
Activities include: guided walks, game drives (day and night) in open 4WD LandCruiser.

<h3>Sanctuary Sussi & Chuma:</h3>

<p>Sanctuary Sussi & Chuma is named after explorer David Livingstone's two faithful companions who carried his body all the way back to England from Zambia. The lodge itself is an exclusive haven in the heart of Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park, which in addition to the mighty roar of the Victoria Falls, also boasts a wide variety of game as well as countless opportunities for adventure.</p>
<p>The main lodge is built on two levels, perched in giant ebony trees overlooking the river. Guests can relax in the swimming pool or the treatment room, or enjoy a drink in the elevated bar. There are 12 air-conditioned tree houses here, connected by wooden walkways. Each one enjoys superb views over the river and is open plan with shower, bathtub, vanity area and private toilet. In addition, there are two private houses available, each with two bedrooms, their own dining areas and decks with plunge pools, and their own chefs and house staff.</p>
<p>Activities include: Victoria Falls tour, Nakatindi village visit, game drives, motorboat excursions, sunset river cruise and fishing.

<h3>Sanctuary Zebra Plains Walking Safari Camp </h3>
<p>Sanctuary Zebra Plains offers an authentic walking safari in Zambia. This is Africa away from the crowds and an adventure that doesn't compromise on life's luxuries. You are joined by one of the best guides around who shares his passion and knowledge of the African bush while your evenings are spent in classic style 'under canvas' without forsaking personal service and comfort.</p>
<p>
Situated in the South Luangwa National Park at the confluence of the Luangwa and Chibembe Rivers, Sanctuary Zebra Plains is the perfect location for walking safaris. This specific area of the park boasts many unique game species including eland, Roan antelope, Cookson's Wildebeest and the endemic Thornicroft's giraffe. Game viewing here is considered some of the best in the world and the park has considerable populations of elephant, buffalo, hippo, crocodile and puku. The area is also an ornithologist's paradise with well over 400 bird species.</p>
<p>
Sanctuary Zebra Plains has four tents - all with mosquito nets, en suite facilities and creature comforts including flush toilets. Hot showers are filled manually by your tent attendant for relaxation and rejuvenation after a day spent walking in the bush. The main mess tent offers a dining area serving gourmet, energy filled meals. There is also a small library and bar where guests can sip cocktails as they watch the sun set over the Luangwa River, snorting hippos in the background. Seasonal, this camp operates from June to November, and has been designed to leave the lowest possible carbon footprint.</p>
<p>
Wake up to an early breakfast served in the mess tent before starting your exploration of the South Luangwa on foot. All walking safaris are accompanied by an experienced safari guide who will share with you some of the most fascinating, yet easily missed sights and sounds of the bush. In the company of a safari guide, along with an armed game scout, guests follow animal tracks along sandy paths or watch the grass spring back minutes after a puku antelope has passed. It's not just the big animals that are fascinating - termites, dung beetles, chameleons and the prolific bird life all have their stories to tell.
