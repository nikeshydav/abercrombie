<h4>DINING CARS</h4>
<img src="../images/rovos/abr3.jpg" alt="experience_guide" style="float:right; margin:0 0 0 10px; width:189px;" /></p>
<p>The Classic and Edwardian trains journey with stunning pre-1940 dining cars. Two A-22 twin diners, characterized by their carved roof-supporting pillars and arches, derived their twin designation from running with a dedicated kitchen car. Coach 195 SHANGANI was found in a scrap yard in 1986; her severely dilapidated condition required 18 months of painstaking restoration. Tragically, this coach was destroyed in a fire one dismal night in 2008. Coach 197 LETABA was acquired in 1987; she became the third dining car restored to service. Coach 205 UMHLALI was purchased in Johannesburg and was fully restored by 2006. In 1936, SAR introduced the A-28/A-29 series of dining cars. This was a significant step up as they had fly-up, fixed seats, large picture windows with ventilators above and no pillars, giving clean modern lines to the interior and exterior. The first batch of four entered traffic in 1936 and Rovos has two in the fleet. Coach 232 UMVOTI was bought by Rovos in 1998. Kitchen car AA-34 286 was sold to Rovos in 1985. Her dining car 231 ZAMBEZI was extracted with difficulty from a shopping centre and returned to service in 2000. During restoration, the ceiling of the coach was improved with extensive use of wooden trimmings while button-leather seats added opulence. It was fitting that they were reunited several years later. In 2010, dining cars 6447 and 5274 were added to the consist. The first was built from a second-class sleeper, while 5274 was rusted through and a third-class sleeper conversion fondly referred to by the staff as the ‘Rust Bucket’.

<h4>LOUNGE CARS</h4>
<img src="../images/rovos/abr1.jpg" alt="experience_guide" style="float:right; margin:0 0 0 10px; width:189px;" /></p>
<p>Expansion plans in 1995 saw the Classic trains move from 42 to 72 guests, making a second lounge car an essential. Coaches 3215, 8337 and 3293 were originally modern steel-sided sleeper cars. They were stripped and refurbished to craft comfortable non-smoking lounge cars, which are placed in the middle of the trains usually ahead of the dining cars. Deep sofas and wingback chairs make for a luxurious comfort car in which guests nodding off for an afternoon snooze are a common sight. The lounge cars are used as lecture rooms on the annual Dar es Salaam journeys and also house a small, discreet gift shop. As with all the service cars, the lounges are air-conditioned, yet the windows can be opened allowing in the sights, sounds and scents of Africa. There are few, if any, luxury trains anywhere in the world with this special feature, which has proved of particular benefit when a train has been chartered for a Steam Safari – steam enthusiasts like to enjoy the full majesty of a working locomotive and windows that open are top priority. This feature, coupled with luxury and service as well as a selection of Rovos Rail steam locomotives, makes this a truly exceptional opportunity to experience long-distance travel behind steam traction.

<h4>CLUB CARS</h4>
<img src="../images/rovos/abr4.jpg" alt="experience_guide" style="float:right; margin:0 0 0 10px; width:189px;" />
The Club Car area was fashioned by demolishing the end suite in a deluxe carriage. This was done specifically to host the smokers on the train in a public area, and also as an overflow facility adjoining the Observation Car. With a glass passage wall, guests can luxuriously enjoy the scenery on both sides of the train.
