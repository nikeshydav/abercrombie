<dt><h2>BORGO EGNAZIA</h2> 
<p>Inspired by Apulia's rich traditions, yet thoroughly contemporary in its style, Borgo Egnazia is a true masterpiece of architecture where the main element is the typical white tufo stone. The narrow alleys of the Borgo Village are reproduced according to the traditions of the most characteristic Apulian historical centers with a magic stretch stolen by the most enchanting Arabian landscapes.</p>
<div class="thepet">
<p>The Restaurants, surrounded by different and always evocative landscapes and atmospheres, offer very high quality products and cuisine. A diverse menu based upon local produce, mainly home-grown follows the philosophy of the Mediterranean Diet. 
Children are well catered for with the Trullalleri kids club and Fichi d'India teens club offering a wide range of daily activities.</p>
<p>
Sporting activities on offer include two Tennis courts, a grass multiuse court and three swimming pools, one of them indoor. Cala Masciola Beach Club is located inside the property and features typical seaside low rocks.</p>
<p>
For those who want to discover the area and local customs enjoy a cooking class or hop on a horse or bicycle. Alternatively take to the water and sail along the coast or for those looking for more adventure why not partake in a bit of scuba diving, kiting or windsurfing?</p>
<p>
Considered one of the top golf courses in Italy, San Domenico Golf is an 18 hole championship course bordering the crystal azures of the Adriatic Sea. The course is spread over 6300 metres of lush land featuring undulating bermuda grass with sea views from every vantage point. Against a backdrop of the cobalt blue sky and the sea, the Clubhouse is situated a few metres from the Adriatic Coast and the ancient Roman City of Egnazia.</p>

<dt><h2>GRAND HOTEL VILLA CORA</h2> 
<p>Located on a tranquil hilltop position, the Grand Hotel Villa Cora reopened in 2010 after a detailed restoration When Baron Oppenheim built this handsome parkland villa in the late 19th-century he dedicated it to his wife. This romantic gesture echoes throughout the villa with its 46 rooms; 30 in the main villa and 14 in the stables plus Villino Eugenia the gatehouse. The interiors reflect the eclectic passions of the aristo and his belle - namely roses, the Orient, ornate parquet, and spectacular frescoes and statuary.
</p>
<div class="thepet">
<p>Authentic period and antique pieces adorn both the halls of the Villa and the bedrooms. Explore the connecting rooms on the ground floor that lead you through a journey from the Salone degli Specci resembling a mini Versailles to the Sphynx room with its Moorish influences to the White room the perfect location to lounge.</p>
<p>The gourmet restaurant is complimented by a wine cellar and bar. In the summer dining al fresco is the norm at Le Pool with Tuscan cuisine on offer. We particularly enjoy the tasting menu. In winter the indoor restaurant Il Pasha is your home for dinner. Take a table in a booth for added privacy. The spa is located under the gatehouse of the villa and is accessed via a tunnel from the villa itself. Sauna, Hammam, a gym and a selection of treatments are all available.</p>
<p>The hotel's shuttle service will take you to the heart of the city and pick you up when you cannot walk anymore and return you to the peace of the villa and its gardens to enjoy a well-earned glass of Prosseco.</p>
