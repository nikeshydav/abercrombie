</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>ARRIVE BERLIN</h5>
<p>Upon arrival at Berlin airport you will be met in the arrivals hall by your driver and privately transferred to your hotel.
Located on the historic Pariser Platz by Berlin's most famous sight, the Brandenburg Gate, and near to the elegant shops & boutiques of Friedrichstrasse and Museum Island, the recently redeveloped Hotel Adlon is the Grande Dame of Berlin hotels.
The Adlon Kempinski also offers a wonderful spa with heated indoor pool, Jacuzzi, saunas, steam baths and a whole menu of different treatments to add that special touch to your honeymoon.</p>
<p>During your stay you will be treated to a complimentary upgrade (subject to availability), free international phone calls so you can easily contact your loved ones back home, and complimentary Wi-Fi.</p>
<p><strong>overnight:</strong> Hotel Adlon Kempinski Berlin</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>BERLIN</h5>
<p>Today you will enjoy a half-day overview sightseeing tour (4 hours) with your private vehicle and local English-speaking guide giving you a wonderful introduction to the sights of Berlin. Begin your tour at the newly created Potsdamer Platz, dubbed "Europe's largest construction site" during the mid 1990s and see the nearby Checkpoint Charlie, the famous crossing point between East and West Berlin. Continue to the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, whose ruin stands as a dramatic reminder of World War II. </p>
<p>
Before you return back to your hotel enjoy a romantic horse drawn carriage ride, sipping a glass of champagne as you are carried along Unter den Linden, see the Gendarmenmarkt and return to Brandenburg Gate through Berlin's most beautiful alleys. (Warm blankets will be provided depending on the weather)</p>
<p>This afternoon is at your leisure to relax and enjoy the facilities of your hotel.</p>
<p>Alternatively you may like to visit the Charlottenburg Palace. Dating from 1695, the Palace was restored to its original elegance following World War II. The vast and beautiful palace is now home to the most richly decorated interiors and artifacts in Berlin.</p>
<p>As another option you may enjoy a short walk to the Museum Island, for a visit to one of the world's greatest museums; the Pergamon Museum which houses a vast collection of ancient artifacts and antiquities. You may also like to visit Berlin Cathedral with its vast dome before walking back to your hotel.</p>
<p> <strong>Overnight:</strong> Adlon Kempinski Berlin<br /> 
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>BERLIN</h5>
<p>Today enjoy a full day with a guide and driver (8 hours) on a food & art tour of Berlin. Start with a visit to the Turkish market in Kreuzberg on the banks of the canal (Tuesday + Friday only).</p>
<p>Alternatively, visit the Marheineke Halle, an indoor, organic food market also in Kreuzberg which sells flowers, meat, fruit and veg as well as typical Berlin snacks (open Monday - Saturday) You will also take a trip to the Bonbon Macherei, a traditional sweet making shop, in the Heckmann Höfe - one of the hidden courtyards in the Mitte district.</p>
<p>Finally, pay a visit to 'KaDeWe' or Kaufhaus des Westens, a prestigious department store in West Berlin that was opened in 1907. KaDeWe has a mouthwatering food court on the 6th floor with a selection of food and drink to rival Harrods in London. During your tour your guide will treat you to some delicious snacks along the way, such as a traditional Berlin currywurst (the best of these are found in Kreuzberg apparently), Berliner Weiße (beer with red or green syrup) as well as some patisserie or petit four from kadewe.</p>
<p>This afternoon you may like to pay a visit to Tacheles, a wacky, colourful artists residence which houses a number of quirky modern works of art. The building is a former department store in the Jewish quarter (Scheunenviertel) of Berlin. It served as a Nazi prison during the Second World War and recently it was taken over by artists who called it Tacheles which is Yiddish for "straight talking." The building is a popular place for visitors, however the lease with the property owner expired at the end of 2008 and the future of the art house is now uncertain.</p>
<p>Finally, visit the 'Hackesche Höfe,' one of the most famous and attractive of Berlin's interconnecting courtyards in the Mitte district. Formerly a rather neglected area, Hackescher Markt has developed into a cultural and commercial centre since the German reunification and has become famous for its nightlife. Return to your hotel from here.</p>
<p> <strong>Overnight:</strong> Hotel Adlon Kempinski Berlin <br />

<h4>Day 4</h4>

The Serengeti perhaps defines the safari experience as surely as the wildlife that inhabits it. Established in 1951, and covering an area of almost 15,000 sq km, an area comparable to the state of Connecticut or Northern Ireland, the Serengeti hosts a fantastically diverse ecosystem. The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, where 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other plains game that follow close behind, make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";

The Selous supports around one million game animals, is bigger than Switzerland and is a World Heritage site.

Transfer from Arusha to Ngorongoro Crater Lodge located on the rim with spectacular views across the crater. The Ngorongoro Crater is the largest unbroken caldera in the world and the first sight of it is breathtaking.<br /><br />Ngorongoro Crater Lodge is situated on the edge of the ancient crater rim above the cool, swirling mists. The lodge is a return to the noble elegance of the travelling colonials. Inspired in design by the Maasai Manyatta, three separate camps of 6 to 12 suites each remember a bygone era when characters such as Lord Delamere adorned the stilted, handcrafted structures with graceful antiques, grand chandeliers and treasures collected from travels through Africa.<br /><br /></p>";

Rhinos can often be seen with calves at heel. Eland and waterbuck appear not to notice the human visitors, enabling photographers to shoot at ease.

The camp offers spectacular views across Tortillis woodland situated on the edge of the short grass plains. The camp is comprised of nine double tents scattered around the kopje with the mess tent and common area as the central feature. Privacy between tents is guaranteed as they are at a substantial distance from each other and are generally concealed by a tree or kopje.<br /></p>";
