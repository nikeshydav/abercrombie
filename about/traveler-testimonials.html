<p>The main highlight for our December trip to Tanzania was the very unique Wildlife Sightseeing. An excellent experience enriched with the courteous and knowledgeable local guides. Our guide Fred was extremely well informed on the wildlife, flora and also the tribal customs and traditions. He was also able to fulfill the high expectations of the two youngsters on the trip which was no mean task in terms of deliverables on wildlife! From the selection of the vehicles used for commuting to the outstanding accommodations chosen for us ( (particularly Kusini and the Manor) ), every detailing was very well appreciated.  Would love to travel again with A&K. </p>

<p> On my trip to Vietnam, we stayed at  Park Hyatt, at Ho Chi Minh City and in general, we are very happy with the services and are enjoying every detailing of the trip. All is excellent, I have no complain, everything is perfect from the tour guide, vehicle, hotels, restaurants, sightseeing. </p>

 The guide in central - Vuong was outstanding - he was charming, nice, with excellent English speaking skills,  very flexible and very knowledgeable too. The Sofitel Metropole in Hanoi was even better than Park Hyatt, but since Sofitel is an American brand so all rooms were simple and the same as others. But Sofitel is a very charming hotel to stay in. I loved Hoi An the most and the Nam Hai was the best hotel that I have ever been to. I travel a lot so the next time, if I would come back, I only want to go to Hoi An and stay at the Nam Hai. This is the first time I have traveled with A&K  and I am very happy with their services. Next time, I will come back to do Cambodia & Laos.<br /><br />

<p>  Our tour guide was knowledgeable and courteous. The Grand Hotel in Amsterdam is very good, specially their restaurant. For strict vegetarians like us, we are used to managing with 'average' meals in European hotels.But this restaurant is excellent. Also, we were upgraded to a bigger suite, which really helped. The A& K team was always available on phone to answer many queries. </p>

 What I loved the most about KohSamui was that, the children were spoilt with choice - mini golf, Go-Karting,animal safari, speed boating, jet skiing. So for a family with children, it was ideal.
All in all we had a wonderful experience. Thanks for your help."<br />

<p>	Appointing tourism graduated guides is a very good policy by A&K. Conversation with such people is more fact-filled and accurate in terms of details, and the conversation more meaningful.

It's a treat when your guide can handle photography for a couple traveling like us. Our guide was an honest and objective guy with a great sense of humor, who took the trouble of carrying with him CD's to introduce us to the music of Argentine. Our guide took great pride in is work and his service did not just limit to the itinerary issued to us. He brought in books and even paraphernalia to make their famous matte tea as we drove in the car.<br /><br />
All the accompanying guides were knowledgeable, very client oriented, flexible and willing to extend their services to longer than the working hours. Regardless of price or time we were allowed to order-to out heart's content: food and wine (of our choice).<br />
My wife and I were introduced to the history, economics and social life of South America. All the guides were flexible, punctual and wanted us to enjoy our experience.<br /><br />

A&K's policy of escorting client's door-to door was very much appreciated by us. We were very happy by the services provided by A&K."
