<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong>  12 days </p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong> &bull; Cruise in style and comfort on board 'Le Boreal,' the
only all-balcony vessel in Antarctica when chartered
by A&K <br />
&bull; Discover some of the world's rarest wildlife and terrain
on excursions led by the region's most seasoned guides<br />
&bull; Learn about Antarctica's environment - and efforts to
conserve it - on a visit to a working scientific
research station<br />
&bull; Gain a deep understanding of the region with enriching
lectures by award-winning experts<br />
&bull; Leave the details to us - this all-inclusive journey
includes on-board gratuities, unlimited drinks (except
premium wines, premium liquors and champagne) and
all port charges on 'Le Boreal'<br />
&bull; Save time with private charter flights to and from Ushuaia</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>Arrive Buenos  Aires</h5>
<p> An A&K welcome on arrival into the Argentine capital and a private transfer to your hotel. This afternoon meet some of your fellow passengers and join a small group orientation tour of Buenos Aires. This evening there is a cocktail reception at your hotel.</p>

<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Sofitel Buenos Aires<br />

</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Buenos  Aires/ Ushuaia</h5>
<p>Transfer as a group to the airport for the charter flight* to Ushuaia - the world's southernmost city. You are met and taken on a scenic drive followed by lunch, prior to embarkation. MV Le Boreal is a stylish passenger-friendly vessel and the first all-balcony stateroom and suite vessel to travel to Antarctica. Wander the decks, relax in the lounge and mingle with fellow adventurers in anticipation of your voyage.</p>

<p><strong>Overnight:</strong>MV Le Boreal
<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3-4</h4>
<h5>Cruising  the  Drake  Passage</h5>
<p> The journey southward towards Antarctica is an exciting one. An important trade route in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the Drake Passage's stormy waters and icy conditions often made the journey around Cape Horn a difficult one, though the stabilizer-equipped 'Le Boreal' handles it easily. The krill-rich waters are a particular favorite with marine mammals and seabirds </p>
<p>
As  you  travel  in  the  comfort  of  your  luxury  cruiser,  enjoy  several  enriching  lectures  by
 leading experts on topics spanning Antarctic birdlife to photography. In the afternoons, join 'Le Boreal's' naturalists on deck to look for various species of whale and abundant seabirds. Evenings present opportunities to chat with experts about the wildlife spotted during the day and discuss the program ahead.
</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> MV Le Boreal<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5-9 </h4>
<h5>Antarctica</h5>
<p> As the Antarctic Peninsula and its offshore islands appear on the horizon, a sense of excitement begins to build. Day-to-day itineraries depend on the weather, water and wildlife conditions, but two excursions are carefully planned for each day by the captain and expedition leader. Each day begins with an early breakfast. Afterward, venture out in swift Zodiacs, guided by expert drivers and accompanied by lecturers, to a number of sites, which may include the penguin-filled islands in the South Shetlands of Half Moon, Penguin or Deception; islands off the continental coastline such as Cuverville or Paulet; and, weather permitting, the Antarctic Peninsula. 'Le Boreal' also plans to sail through stunning Paradise Bay and the Lemaire Channel, referred to as "Kodak Alley."</p>
<p>
After a morning exploring native species and terrain, return to 'Le Boreal' for lunch. In the afternoon, set out for the day's second excursion, which may include a visit to a scientific research station or the remains of turn-of-the-century whaling and sealing stations. Return to your vessel for cocktails and dinner. Afterwards, recap the day's discoveries with your naturalist guides.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> MV Le Boreal<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 10-11</h4>
<h5>Drake Passage</h5>
<p>The ship's return through the Drake Passage is an interlude for recap and reflection, with time to compare notes with your lecturers on the wildlife, history and geology of the White Continent. While cruising through this historic passage, named in honor of Sir Francis Drake's voyage in the 16th century, you may be able to spot whale and seabirds such as albatross and skua.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight: </strong>MV Le Boreal   <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day  12</h4>
<h5>Ushuaia  -  Buenos  Aires</h5>
<p> Disembark after breakfast, and transfer to the airport to board your charter flight* back to Buenos Aires where arrangements end.</p>
<p><strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>

<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 12 days</p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong> &bull; Cruise in style and comfort on board 'Le Boreal,' the
only all-balcony vessel in Antarctica when chartered
by A&K <br />
&bull; Discover some of the world's rarest wildlife and terrain

</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>Arrive Buenos Aires, Argentina</h5>
<p>Arrive this morning to Argentina's capital and transfer to your hotel, where immediate check-in has been arranged. Enjoy some time to relax before this afternoon's city tour. As complex as it is energetic and seductive, this port city has been the gateway to Argentina for centuries, bringing many portenos (as locals are known) into its boundaries. Although it is reminiscent of a European city, the spirit of Buenos Aires is evident in its diverse and distinctly local neighborhoods. Meet your fellow adventurers this evening for a welcome cocktail reception.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Hotel Sofitel Buenos Aires <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Buenos Aires/Ushuaia</h5>
<p>Today, take a flight down to Ushuaia, the southernmost city in the world and a charming seaside town. Upon arrival, enjoy sightseeing (time permitting) and a traditional Patagonian barbecue lunch. Later this afternoon, arrive at your ship and settle in for your first night on board. Only on A&K journeys to the White Continent, the passenger-friendly, stylish 'Le Boreal' features all-balcony staterooms and suites. Wander the decks to become acquainted with the ship, relax in the lounge and mingle with fellow guests in anticipation of your voyage. </p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Le Boreal <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B, L, D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3-4</h4>
<h5>Cruising the Drake Passage</h5>
<p>The southward journey toward Antarctica is an exciting one. An important trade route in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the Drake Passage is a 600 -mile-wide swath of water where the Southern Ocean currents are squeezed between South America's southern tip and Antarctica's northernmost reaches. Its stormy waters and icy conditions often made the journey around</p>
<p>
Cape Horn a difficult one, though the stabilizer-equipped 'Le Boreal' handles it easily. The krill-rich waters of the Drake Passage are a particular favorite with marine mammals and seabirds. As you travel in the comfort of your luxury cruiser, enjoy several enriching lectures every day by leading experts on topics spanning Antarctica, from birdlife and geology to photography and history. After lunch, join your naturalists on the deck to look for various species of whales and abundant seabirds, all just a taste of the wildlife you will encounter in the days to come. Later in the evening, chat with experts about the wildlife spotted today and discuss the next day's itinerary. </p>

<h4>Day 5-9</h4>
<h5>Antarctica</h5>
<p>As the Antarctic Peninsula and its offshore islands appear on the horizon, a sense of excitement begins to build. While day-to-day itineraries depend on the weather, water and wildlife conditions, two excursions are carefully planned for each day by the captain and expedition leader. (See page 30 for an example of a day in Antarctica.) Each cruise day begins with an early breakfast. Afterward, venture out in swift Zodiacs - guided by expert drivers and accompanied by lecturers, in groups of no more than 12 guests - to a number of sites, which may include the penguin-filled islands in the South Shetlands of Half Moon, Penguin or Deception; islands off the continental coastline such as Cuverville, Paulet or Vortex; and, weather permitting, the fabled Antarctic Peninsula.</p>
<p>
'Le Boreal' also plans to sail through Paradise Bay and the Lemaire Channel, referred to as "Kodak Alley" for its stunning, camera-ready vistas of towering icebergs and deep blue waters. After a morning exploring native species and striking terrain, return to 'Le Boreal' for lunch and perhaps some time to relax and scan the wildlife-rich waters that surround you. In the afternoon, set out for the day's second excursion, which may include a visit to a scientific research station, the remains of turn-of-the-century whaling and sealing stations, a sheltered beach teeming with basking elephant seals or simply circumnavigating colossal icebergs that serve as floating homes to seals and penguins. Return to your cruiser to relax and chat over cocktails in the cozy, comfortable lounge and enjoy dinner in the dining room. Afterward, you may choose to recap the day's discoveries with your naturalist guides or enjoy time on deck, taking photos in the stunning low light characteristic of Antarctica's long, ethereal twilight.

<h4>Day 10-11</h4>
<h5>Drake Passage</h5>
<p>Bid farewell to wondrous Antarctica and begin your cruise back to Ushuaia. The ship's return through the Drake Passage is an interlude for recap and reflection, with time to compare notes with your expert lecturers on the wildlife, history and geology of the White Continent. Spend time on board with newfound friends in the comfortable common spaces of 'Le Boreal,' relax in your spacious cabin and absorb the fascinating lectures by your excellent expedition team. While cruising through this historic passage, you may spot various species of whales and seabirds such as skuas and albatrosses.</p>
<p>
The latter are an especially beautiful sight to behold - these birds boast a wingspan of 11.5 feet on average, using their powerful wings to glide through the air for hours at a time in search of food.

Hugging the Atlantic coast road we journey past the bikini beaches of Clifton, Camps Bay and Llandudno, beautifully located at the base of the towering Twelve Apostles Mountains. We travel over the Suikerbossie (Sugar Bush) Pass and descend into the bucolic Hout Bay valley, with its bustling fishing harbour, white sand beach and picturesque village.<br /></p><p align=justify>In Hout Bay we will cruise the waters to Seal Island, home to the Cape Fur Seal. It is a wondrous show to behold - a water ballet by a thousand seals, pirouetting, diving and surfacing to a symphony of gull cries, timpani courtesy of the South Atlantic swell gently keeping time against the ancient granite shore. If you want to see a special part of the Peninsula from another perspective, this is about as good as it gets.</p><p align=justify>We travel over the famous Chapman's Peak Drive (subject to road conditions) to join the sea again at the town of Noordhoek. This historic road, high on the mountainside overlooking the sea, was once considered impossible to build, but Charl Marais (mining surveyor) rose to the challenge and Chapman's Peak Drive was opened to the public in 1922. Our journey continues to the Cape of Good Hope Nature Reserve at the end of the Cape Peninsula.</p><p align=justify>The reserve, which covers 22000 acres of land, converges in the south at Cape Point, a great pinnacle of rock. You can climb the steps or ride a funicular railway - the Flying Dutchman - to the top from where you may see southern right whales in spring and early summer, dolphins and a variety of seabirds. The original lighthouse at Cape Point was built in 1860.</p><p align=justify>The present lighthouse, one of the most powerful in the southern hemisphere, is closer to the point itself than the original. An alternative option (for the more energetic) is to take a scenic cliff-top trail to the Cape of Good Hope itself, the most south-westerly point in Africa, where your guide and vehicle would meet you. Afterwards we travel back through the reserve looking out for some of the animals that live here, including the rare Bontebok, Eland, Cape Mountain Zebra and Ostrich.</p><p align=justify>En route to lunch we visit Boulders, a lovely beach sheltered from the wind and famous for its colony of endangered Jackass Penguins on the coast of False Bay near Simon's Town. Boulders, had just two breeding pairs in 1982, but thanks to careful management the population has grown to about 3000 in recent years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p align=justify>Pass through Simon's Town, which was the Royal Navy's main base in the south Atlantic from 1815 until 1957 and has the feel of a small English seaside village with steep narrow streets and cobbled alleyways. You will learn about the famous hound called Just Nuisance, the most renowned animal in the annals of the Royal Navy. We continue to Kalk Bay the quaint fishing hamlet on the False Bay coast with a protected little harbour of brightly painted wooden boats.</p><p align=justify>The narrow main street is renowned for antique and art shops which make fascinating browsing. We lunch in Kalk Bay before journeying back into Cape Town via Boyes Drive for wonderful views of the harbour. We emerge above Muizenberg a famous location in South African history as it was the site of the Battle of Muizenberg in 1795 when British forces invaded the Cape and defeated the Dutch colonists.</p><p align=justify>We travel back towards Cape Town passing through the attractive, up-market suburb of Constantia, the cradle of the South African wine industry boasting famous estates like Klein Constantia. We continue to Streetwires passing interesting sites such as the University of Cape Town, Rhodes Memorial and Mostert's Mill, a Dutch windmill dating back to 1797 and still in working order.&nbsp;</p><p align=justify>Thereafter we return to the hotel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";

This World Heritage Site is one of the places where man is believed to have originated.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You will visit the private, working site of Drimolen which was only discovered in 1992 and is already the third richest hominid site in Southern Africa. Access to this site is by arrangement only. On 26 April 2000, the discovery of the most complete female Australopithecus robustus skull along with a complete male jaw which made world headlines.&nbsp;</p><p>This site has unearthed 79 hominid fossils, a wealth of faunal remains and some fossil Homo babies. As the site is being excavated all year round, it provides an excellent opportunity to see an excavation in progress.

A light, catered picnic lunch will be provided under the trees, before heading back to Johannesburg for a guided visit of the South African Museum of Rock Art at the Origins Centre. This world-class facility was recently opened at the University of the Witwatersrand. The museum has an outstanding, and fascinating, collection of rock paintings, engravings and artifacts, but more importantly, the history of South Africa is told through the art of the San people. If we want to understand the culture, the spiritual beliefs, and the very essence of the Zulu and Xhosa people as they are today, and even the reasons for the development of Soweto and other townships - we need to take a step back a few hundred years, and follow the path that the rock art stories can tell us.&nbsp;</p><p>Originally San rock art was seen as just pictures of animals and people, and narrative accounts of the hunter-gatherer life. Only now have researchers discovered the spiritual meaning behind the rock art, and their importance. Rock paintings and engravings have proved a valuable tool for Nature Conservationists, as the San provided historical evidence of wildlife species that occurred in their area hundreds of years ago.</p><p>Return to your hotel in the late afternoon.</p>";

The aim is to bridge the gap between the wild world of the Baboons and the civilised world of their human cousins.</p><p>The remaining Chacma Baboons on the southern peninsula (close to Cape Town), face a bleak future as continued urbanization reduces wilderness areas, resulting in on-going conflict situations between man and baboon. Due to the unacceptably high mortality rates it was predicted that within 15 years the baboons would face certain extinction. At the current mortality rate there will not be a viable baboon population on the peninsula within the next 10 years.</p><p>The Baboon Monitor Project was started in 1999 and over the past five years has considerably reduced the conflicts between primates by keeping baboons out of villages for 85% of days. The project employs 8 men from the nearby community of Masiphumelele. These men have been working closely with the baboons and have gained a wealth of wildlife experience as well as developing unique relationships with the baboons of the Da Gama and Slangkop troops. Funding for the Baboon Monitor Project is an on-going concern as pressing social issues dominate the current funding situation in South Africa.</p><p>To support this important conservation initiative, 25% of net proceeds from this walk will be utilized to ensure the continuation of the Baboon Monitor Project. By taking part in this excursion, you are showing your support for this important conservation initiative. You will be guided across the mountains around Cape Town to spend time with the last remaining Chacma Baboons in the Cape Peninsula. For 2-3 hours you will be walking through the mountain fynbos until you encounter the baboons in their home territory.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to sit and watch these fascinating animals as they eat, play and socialize around you.
