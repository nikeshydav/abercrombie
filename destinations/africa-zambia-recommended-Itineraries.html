In the Mara River, hippos submerge to snort and grumble while crocodiles sunbathe on the riverbanks. Around July to September, rain depending, the Masai Mara is host to the famous wildebeest migration which is one of the few remaining mass migrations of mammals in the world. During this time herds of over a million wildebeest will trawl their way through this region and they become the major focus for predatory activity and drama unfolds at every corner.<br /><br />There are also options for a morning balloon safari or a half-day visit to Lake Victoria.<br /><br />Balloon Safari: As the balloon is inflated against the first rays of sunrise your pilot will go through safety procedures. Once aloft, the balloon floats gently over the plains, giving a bird's eye view of the game below as the sun creeps slowly over the horizon. After around one hour the balloon lands and nearby breakfast is already being prepared and, of course, glasses of bubbly to toast your flight in a tradition initiated by the Montgolfier brothers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lake Victoria Adventure: An early start this morning with a transfer to take you to the airstrip for a flight by light aircraft to Lake Victoria. On arrival enjoy an appetising full English breakfast before you board the boat for the morning.

<h4>Day 11</h4>
<h5>Cape Town City Tour</h5>
<p>Please meet your representative in the reception area of the hotel from where you depart on a morning tour of Cape Town City.</p>
<p>You will be driven through the Cape Town suburb of Tamboerskloof ("Drummers' Ravine") to the lower cable car station on the slopes of Table
Mountain. Weather permitting you will make the short and comfortable ascent to the top of the mountain by cable car. The panoramic view of the
sea and city from the summit is magnificent.</p>
<p>Then you begin our tour of historic Cape Town. After the excitement of "summiting" Table Mountain, you may need some refreshments, so our
first stop will be the Bo Kaap area for an exclusive, traditional Cape Malay tea experience. Our host will tell you about her life growing up in the
charming Bo Kaap where bulbous minarets rise up above buildings festooned with cast-iron adornments from another age and cobble stoned
streets lead into cosy squares.</p>
<p>You will then take an easy walk through the tranquil Company Gardens (the remnants of the Dutch East India Company's fruit and vegetable
gardens) with notable important buildings including the Houses of Parliament, the Tuynhuis ("Townhouse" or Cape Town's "White House"),
National Art Gallery and National Library. From here we make our way to the Castle of Good Hope. Built between 1666 and 1679 by the Dutch
East India Company, this pentagonal fortification replaced a small clay and timber fort, built in 1652 by Commander Jan van Riebeeck, founder
of the maritime replenishment station at the Cape of Good Hope. The Castle Military Museum depicts the military history of the Cape, the Castle
and Cape Regiments. Also worth a visit is the William Fehr collection consisting of artwork reflecting many aspects of cultural life at the Cape
from the early VOC days until the middle of the 19th century.</p>
<p>End your tour visiting the notorious dungeon. As a result of rising damp, the dungeon was not fit to store gun powder as intended and was later
used as a prison for the accused awaiting trial.</p>
<p>The tour will end at the hotel or at the bustling Victoria & Alfred Waterfront, built around the old harbour. A hugely popular destination with
tourists and locals alike (80% of visitors are from Cape Town itself) the Waterfront is unique in terms of being a working harbour while still
boasting a varied selection of eclectic shops, restaurants and tourist attractions from scenic helicopter rides to boat cruises.</p>

<h4>Day 12</h4>
<h5>Cape Point Tour</h5>
<p>Please meet your representative in the reception area of the hotel and depart on a full day tour to Cape Point.</p>
<p>Hugging the Atlantic coast road we journey past the "bikini beaches" of Clifton and Camps Bay, beautifully located at the base of the towering
Twelve Apostles Mountains. We travel over the Suikerbossie ("Sugar Bush") Pass and descend into the bucolic Hout Bay valley, with its bustling
fishing harbour and white sand beach.</p>
<p>From here we travel over the famous Chapman's Peak Drive (subject to road conditions) to join the sea again at the town of Noordhoek. This
historic road, high on the mountainside overlooking the sea, was once considered "impossible to build", but Charl Marais (mining surveyor) rose
to the challenge and made it happen at an estimated cost of £20 000 using 700 convict labourers.</p>
<p>Our journey continues to the Cape of Good Hope Nature Reserve at the end of the Cape Peninsula. The reserve, which covers 22000 acres of
land, converges in the south at Cape Point, a great pinnacle of rock. You can climb the steps or ride a funicular railway - the "Flying Dutchman" -
to the top from where you MAY see Southern Right whales in spring and early summer, dolphins and a variety of seabirds. The original
lighthouse at Cape Point was built in 1860. The present lighthouse, one of the most powerful in the southern hemisphere, is closer to the point
itself than the original.</p>
<p>We travel back through the reserve looking out for some of the animals that live here, including the rare Bontebok, Eland and Cape Mountain
Zebra.</p>
<p>En route to lunch we visit Boulders, a lovely beach sheltered from the wind and famous for its colony of endangered Jackass Penguins on the
coast of False Bay near Simon's Town. Boulders, had just two breeding pairs in 1982 but thanks to careful management the population has
grown to about 3000 in recent years. This is a rare and rewarding experience.</p>
<p>Pass through Simon's Town, which was the Royal Navy's main base in the south Atlantic from 1815 until 1957 and has the feel of a small English
seaside village with steep narrow streets and cobbled alleyways. You will learn about the famous hound called "Just Nuisance", the most
renowned animal in the annals of the Royal Navy.</p>
<p>Continue to Kalk Bay a quaint fishing hamlet on the False Bay coast with a protected little harbour of brightly painted wooden boats. At around
1pm the fishermen offload their catch and it is possible to buy your supper straight from the boat.</p>
<p>Travel back towards Cape Town passing through the attractive, upmarket suburb of Constantia, the cradle of the South African wine industry
boasting famous estates like Klein Constantia. At Kirstenbosch the world-renowned National Botanical Garden, recently voted one of the Top
Ten gardens in the World by the curators of Kew Gardens in London, a private, local guide ensures that you learn about some of the more
fascinating aspects of the gardens and get as much as possible out of the visit. We return to the hotel passing interesting sites such as the
University of Cape Town, Rhodes Memorial and Mostert's Mill, a Dutch windmill dating back to 1797.</p>

<h5>Gourmet Tour of the Winelands</h5>

<p>The Western Cape is blessed with a climate, which enables world-class wines to be made here in the midst of scenery - and on historic estates -
which even jaded eyes agree are breathtakingly beautiful.</p>
<p>The region is also an epicurean's dream with a host of top quality restaurants ready and able to seduce the palate with a myriad of taste
sensations, which are both internationally classic and yet uniquely local. On this exclusive gourmet experience you will sample some of the
award winning wines - and tastes - of the Western Cape.</p>
<p>Depart the hotel - and travel along the N1 National Highway to Anura Estate. Anura is situated in the foothills of the Simonsberg mountain range.
Here you will be able to sample their wines - and award-winning hand crafted Forest Hill cheeses.</p>
<p>Continue on to Waterford Wine Estate via the picturesque historic town of Stellenbosch - the second oldest town in South Africa - and also
known as the town of oaks. When you arrive at Waterford Wine Estate, you will have the opportunity to sample their award winning wines
complimented by a chocolate tasting.</p>
<p>After the wine and chocolate tasting you will enjoy lunch on the Kleine Zalze Estate at the Cape Winelands restaurant Terroir, which scooped the
year's most prestigious accolade on the gastronomic calendar. The Provencal-inspired chalkboard menu is dictated to seasonal, fresh and
organic produce from the region accompanied by wines from the area.</p>
<p>Once you have relaxed after lunch, continue to Somerset West, which lies in the valley beneath the Hottentot's Holland Mountains. Visit
Morgenster Estate for a wine, olive and olive oil tasting. Morgenster produces an extra virgin olive oil, which has been judged the best in the
world at a prestigious competition in Italy. The wines are also top ranking.</p>

Elephants browse amongst the large herds of wildebeest and topi, gazelle, eland and buffalo. The plains offer a rich variety of food for the dominant predators: lion, leopard, hyena and cheetah. In the Mara River, hippos submerge to snort and grumble while crocodiles sunbathe on the riverbanks. Around July to September, rain depending, the Masai Mara is host to the famous wildebeest migration which is one of the few remaining mass migrations of mammals in the world. During this time herds of over a million wildebeest will trawl their way through this region and they become the major focus for predatory activity and drama unfolds at every corner.<br /><br />There are also options for a morning balloon safari or a half-day visit to Lake Victoria.<br /><br />Balloon Safari: As the balloon is inflated against the first rays of sunrise your pilot will go through safety procedures. Once aloft, the balloon floats gently over the plains, giving a bird's eye view of the game below as the sun creeps slowly over the horizon. After around one hour the balloon lands and nearby breakfast is already being prepared and, of course, glasses of bubbly to toast your flight in a tradition initiated by the Montgolfier brothers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lake Victoria Adventure: An early start this morning with a transfer to take you to the airstrip for a flight by light aircraft to Lake Victoria. On arrival enjoy an appetising full English breakfast before you board the boat for the morning.
