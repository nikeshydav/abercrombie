Or take a visit to the lovely Vrtba's Gardens, near the Church of Our Lady Victorious (open daily from April till October).</p>
<p>If music is the food of love, what better way to spend the afternoon that with a private musical tour of Prague. The location of the Czech Museum of Music is within the former Baroque church of St. Mary Magdalene in the Little Quarter, the National Museum has taken the unique opportunity to update this space - once decorated with Baroque masterpieces and resounding with supposedly one of the biggest organs of 17th-century Prague. Also enjoy a visit to the Museum of Antonin Dvorak, located in a baroque Vila 'Amerika', since 1932 in an important early 18th century building of architect Kili?n Ign?c Dienzenhofer. End your Musical tour of Prague by a private walk-through the Estate Theatre, lasting about 60 minutes with explanation about the theatre renovation, history and work of W.A. Mozart in this theatre.</p>

<h5>NEUSCHWANSTEIN &AMP; LINDERHOF</h5>
<p>After breakfast you will set off with your English-speaking guide and private vehicle with driver into the Bavarian countryside (9 hours), beginning your tour at Neuschwanstein Castle. Due to its magical beauty it attracts many visitors from near and far, and it is best visited early, before it gets too busy. Looking more like a stage set than a real palace, it is no wonder Walt Disney used it as the model for his sleeping beauty castle and later Disneyland castle itself. Its construction almost brought Bavaria to bankruptcy and Ludwig's early death in the lake is rumoured to be closely connected with this. Do try to find time to walk to the Marienbrucke (Mary's Bridge) crossing a deep, narrow gorge. From this vantage point you have the best and probably most photographed views of this stunning fairy tale castle. (Please note this visit is NOT suitable for anyone with walking problems).  You will also see Ludwig II's country retreat at Linderhof.  The Rococo styling of the Schloss Linderhof is said to have been styled on Versailles, Paris.  After sightseeing, return to your hotel in Munich.</p>

<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 10 days</p>
<p>A Christmas-themed 10-day itinerary for the month of December, featuring three beautiful and festive cities, all of which are renowned for their spectacular Christmas markets and all year round appeal.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong> Berlin, Prague, Munich</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>BERLIN</h5>
<p> Upon arrival at Berlin Airport you will be welcomed to Germany in the arrivals hall by your local representative, and transferred to your hotel where you will be assisted with your check-in.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Hotel de Rome</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>BERLIN</h5>
<p>Start your first morning in Berlin with a 4 hour overview sightseeing tour, with the expert guidance of your local English-speaking guide and in the comfort of your private vehicle. Begin your tour at the recently created Potsdamer Platz, dubbed 'Europe's largest construction site' during the mid 1990s but now a bustling square. The Square comes alive at this time of year with a winter wonderland of lights, music, handicraft and food stalls and a festive ice rink to get you in the magical Christmas spirit.</p>
<p>
Continue along your route where you will see Checkpoint Charlie, the famous crossing point between East and West Berlin and the spectacular headquarters of the DZ Bank, located on Pariser Platz 3 close to the Brandenburg Gate. It was designed by the American architect Frank Gehry, best known for the fantastic Guggenheim building in Bilbao. The interior courtyard is home to Gehry's towering, curvaceous fish that houses a central conference space and captures motion and movement in the building. (Since this is a bank, it is only possible to enter inside the inner lobby which has clear glass doors). Your guide will share fascinating facts about Berlin's turbulent past and you'll hopefully gain a real feel for the city.</p>
<p>
Also visit the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church whose ruins stand as a dramatic reminder of World War II. The church will be set against the atmospheric backdrop of one of the city's most popular Christmas markets, dominated by the 20m high Christmas tree and dazzling lights around the elaborately decorated Breitscheidplatz.</p>
<p>
After your lunch at leisure your guide will once again be on hand for up to 4 hours to give you an orientation tour on foot of some more of the best Christmas markets this city has to offer. There are in fact in excess of 50 markets, some of which are magical and traditional and others more trendy and lively - feel free to tell your guide your preferences so they can adapt the tour for you. However, we would strongly recommend you include the WeihnachtsZauber on Gendarmenmarkt, located in one of the most beautiful squares in the city where you will be greeted with the smells of roasted almonds, hot cocoa and mulled wine. As well as the market stalls offering traditional handicrafts and culinary temptations, enjoy the entertainment and atmosphere created by the many jugglers, acrobats and musical ensembles in the square.</p>
<p>
The evening is at your leisure, so why not spend the evening exploring the markets further, which look especially festive when all lit-up. Or take advantage of one of the many cafes with outdoor heaters and blankets to keep you warm whilst enjoying a glass of Gl?hwein.</p>

Not only will you spend time visiting the Palace, which dates back to 1695 and boasts extravagant interiors and richly decorated artifacts, you will also spend time at the Christmas market of festively decorated cabins and glass pagodas doused in romantic light in front of the palace.</p>
<p>Between 2pm and 6pm enjoy Afternoon Tea with a Christmas theme at the Opera Court living room back at your hotel. Originally a lobby of a former bank the room offers a stunning and cozy atmosphere. Choose from a wonderful selection of cakes, sandwiches and an impressive 23 tea options!</p>

At Christmas time this square becomes home to a festive market consisting of brightly decorated wooden huts, selling Czech handicrafts, hot food (corn on the cob, sausages and other local specialties) and warm drinks. Most impressive of all is the Christmas tree, shipped from the Krkonose (Giant) mountains in the North of the Czech Republic. The tree is decorated in a blaze of lights, which are turned on every night round 5pm. Set against a dark gothic skyline, this is a spectacular sight topped by the presence of daily carol singers and bands playing festive tunes.

A wide range of activities are offered at Olonana and you can plan your day to be as active or as leisurely as you wish. Visit the adjacent Maasai village, take a morning bush walk with an armed ranger or enjoy sundowners in the evening or even dinner under the stars in the middle of the African bush.<br /><br />In the Mara, the wildlife is abundant and the swaying grasslands ensure that animals are never out of sight. Elephants browse amongst the large herds of wildebeest, topi, gazelle, eland and buffalo. The plains offer a rich variety of food for the dominant predators: lion, leopard, hyena and cheetah. In the Mara River, hippos submerge while crocodiles sunbathe on the riverbanks.<br /><br />Around July to September, rain depending, the Masai Mara is host to the famous wildebeest migration which is one of the few remaining mass migrations of mammals in the world. During this time herds of over a million wildebeest will trawl their way through this region and they become the major focus for predatory activity and drama unfolds at every corner.<br /><br />There are also options for a morning balloon safari or a half-day visit to Lake Victoria.<br /><br />Balloon Safari: As the balloon is inflated against the first rays of sunrise your pilot will go through safety procedures. Once aloft, the balloon floats gently over the plains, giving a bird's eye view of the game below as the sun creeps slowly over the horizon. After around one hour the balloon lands as breakfast is already being prepared and, of course, enjoy a glass or two of bubbly to toast your flight in a tradition initiated by the Montgolfier brothers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lake Victoria Adventure : An early start this morning with a transfer to the airstrip for a flight by light aircraft to Lake Victoria. On arrival enjoy an appetising full English breakfast before you board the boat for the morning. There will be the opportunity to try fishing for the legendary giant Nile perch found in these waters as you explore the myriad of tiny islands in this region of the lake. An experienced and knowledgeable fisherman captains each boat. There is the chance to stop at a traditional fishing village and see how the villagers live from day to day before returning to the airstrip for your return flight to the Masai Mara.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p>";

Whether this is your first time on safari or a return trip the Serengeti will not disappoint.<br /><br />The Serengeti National Park is arguably the most famous national park in the world. The Serengeti perhaps defines the safari experience as surely as the wildlife that inhabits it. Established in 1951, and covering an area of almost 15,000 sq km, an area comparable to the state of Connecticut or Northern Ireland, the Serengeti hosts a fantastically diverse ecosystem. The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, where 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other plains game that follow close behind, make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";

The Selous supports around one million game animals, is bigger than Switzerland and is a World Heritage site.

Transfer from Arusha to Ngorongoro Crater Lodge located on the rim with spectacular views across the crater. The Ngorongoro Crater is the largest unbroken caldera in the world and the first sight of it is breathtaking.<br /><br />Ngorongoro Crater Lodge is situated on the edge of the ancient crater rim above the cool, swirling mists. The lodge is a return to the noble elegance of the travelling colonials. Inspired in design by the Maasai Manyatta, three separate camps of 6 to 12 suites each remember a bygone era when characters such as Lord Delamere adorned the stilted, handcrafted structures with graceful antiques, grand chandeliers and treasures collected from travels through Africa.<br /><br /></p>";

Rhinos can often be seen with calves at heel. Eland and waterbuck appear not to notice the human visitors, enabling photographers to shoot at ease.
