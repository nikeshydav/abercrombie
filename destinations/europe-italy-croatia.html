<p style="color:#517390;font-size:14px;">Italy and Croatia make up for a great tourist spot. Where Italy attracts visitors to the pleasures of la dolce vita, Croatia has managed to sweep off hearts with its many natural and architectural treasures, making it a jewel of the Adriatic.</p>
<p>Try an eclectic cultural mix sparkled with love and romance in the luxury tours to Italy. Imagine a scenic experience of snow-capped Alps laden with hilltop villages in the Tuscany and Umbria area in the north and rugged terrain of Sicily in the south. Italy is characterised with vibrant and sophisticated cities that can be contrasted against the simple elegance of the countryside. As the country is relatively new with just 150 years on its chart, each region has a distinct cultural identity attached to it.  Experience the Italian scenic splendour with its unique and rich heritage and for the love of Italy; imbibe in yourself their cuisine, music, art and beauty which make up as its core values.</p>
<p>Croatia speaks of having one of the spectacular coastlines in <a href="http://www.abercrombiekent.co.in/destinations/europe.html">Europe</a>. With more than 6000 kilometres of shoreline and over 1000 islands, reefs and cliffs; its coastline demands special attention. Sparsely populated, these islands have quaint set ups of stone built fishing villages and private coves for ultimate luxury amidst the shade of nature. You can enjoy a true <strong>Croatian holiday</strong>, the Mediterranean way. An unspoilt terrain, this Mediterranean land of Croatia extends from Istrain peninsula in the north to the Dalmatian coast which carries forward to Dubrovnik in the south.</p>
<h1>Best Time To Go Italy & Croatia</h1>
<div class="Clr"></div>
<h4>Best time to go to Italy &amp; Croatia </h4>
<p>Italy -The climate in Italy is diverse, with the central and northern parts best visited during the spring, summer and autumn months. During winter, the Dolomite Mountains are a haven for skiiers.  Further south than Rome, the coastal areas and the islands are a great year round destination, although travel in July and August can be very hot. The arts and opera seasons are generally at their peak outside of July and August, with the exception of Rome and Verona. In the major cities, such as Rome and Milan, August is very much a shut down month with many shops, offices and restaurants closing as Italians take their annual break. This does mean the cities are much less hectic and accommodation is often less expensive than during June or September.
</p>
<p>Croatia - The time period from April to October is considered the best time to visit Croatia. Summer temperatures can reach up to 38°C in mid-summer, while surface water temperatures go up to a pleasant 26°C. July and August are the busiest months due to many Europeans taking their annual vacations over this period. The summer months also see a plethora of cultural activities, such as the Dubrovnik Summer Festival and a series of festivals of music, film and art at the Roman Amphitheatre in Pula. Spring is characterised by pleasant weather accompanied by rare, short showers, while early autumn is ideal for those looking for a tranquil holiday. Out of high season, the beaches are uncrowded and hotel prices significantly lower, while the weather remains stable and warm.</p>

<h1> Travel Tips</h1>
<div class="Clr"></div>

<h4>Time Zone</h4>
<ul class="intrestGrouplisting">
<li>GMT + 1 hour.</li>
</ul>

<div class="Clr"></div>
<h4>Language</h4>
<ul class="intrestGrouplisting">
<li>Croatia - Croatian is the national language and is written in the Latin alphabet. It belongs to the South Slavic language group and is understood in Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Montenegro. Most people who come into regular contact with visitors from overseas speak English to some degree. English speakers can be rare, however, in rural districts.</li>
<li>Italy - the official language is Italian. Of all the major Romance languages, none bears a closer resemblance to Roman Latin than Italianso close, in fact, that a grounding in Latin makes understanding Italian relatively easy. While proficiency in English is not widespread in country districts, major city centres have a larger percentage of fluent English speakers, especially among people whose work brings them into contact with visitors from abroad.</li>
<li>Local Italians and Croatians appreciate travellers' attempts to speak their language, so earn yourself some extra smiles by learning a few polite phrases.</li>

<div id="tab1"><p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;	In Italy, the official currency is the euro, divided into 100 cents.</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Croatia, the official currency is the Kuna, divided into 100 Lipa.</p>
</div>
<div id="tab2" style="display:none;">
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Credit card use is common although American Express is the most popularly accepted.. ATMs can be found in most major cities in Croatia and in Italy they are widespread.</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exchange currency only at authorised outlets such as banks and hotels, and in currency exchanges. Exchange only what you think you will spend in-country. Coins cannot be reconverted on departure.</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Save all receipts from any currency exchange transaction. You may be asked to produce them when you exit the country, and they are required if you intend to reconvert local currency.</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Italy travellers cheques are widely accepted for exchange or purchase in major cities, but in more rural areas, visit a bank to exchange them for Euros. In Croatia with credit card acceptance and ATMs becoming more popular, travellers cheques are becoming less frequently accepted and when presented may receive a less favourable rate of exchange</p>


</div>

<div id="tab3" style="display:none;">
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Croatia - an amount equivalent to approximately 230 Kuna per full day of sightseeing is suggested as a tip for your local guide(s), with 140 Kuna suitable for your driver. For half-day excursions, equivalents of 140 Kuna and 70 Kuna are appropriate for guide and driver respectively. Transfer drivers should be tipped at a rate of about 45 Kuna per service.</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Italy - an amount equivalent to approximately 25 per full day of sightseeing is suggested as a tip for your local guide(s), with 13 suitable for your driver. For half-day excursions, equivalents of 17 and 10 are appropriate for guide and driver respectively. Transfer drivers should be tipped at a rate of about 6 per service and transfer rep at your discretion.  A driver-guide should be tipped 25 for a full day or 17 for a half day of service. These suggestions are per service.</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Hotel porters will expect the equivalent of about 6 Kuna / 1 per bag. Tips to hotel maids and other hotel staff are at your discretion.</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Croatia - Service staff (such as waiters, taxi drivers, and hairdressers) receive a typical gratuity equal to 10% of the total bill.</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Italy - taxi drivers would appreciate a tip of rounding up the fare  (please note that there are two screens on the counter - the left hand is the counter, the right hand is the timer some taxi drivers will charge on the timer! Please be aware and ask the driver to turn the other counter on!).</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Italy - a charge for service is often added to restaurant checks but, if it's not, a typical gratuity would be equal to 10% of the total.</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;	If a Guardian Angel performs a special service for you, it would be appropriate to tip him or her at your discretion. </p>

</p>
</div>


<div id="tab5" style="display:none;">
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Conservative "smart casual" clothing will be most useful for daytime touring in both countries. While jeans are acceptable daytime wear, "smart casual" attire in Italy often means a stylish slacks or skirt outfit for women and a shirt with collar and slacks for men.</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Cotton and other light fabrics are comfortable choice for summertime. Spring and autumn temperatures dictate medium-weight clothing selections. It would be advisable to bring clothing you can layer, remembering that autumn and winter temperatures can be very cold. Pack a coat, hat, gloves, warm socks and sleepwear, etc. if you are visiting between October and April.</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;	When dining at better restaurants and for any special occasion during your journey, dress is more formal. For gentlemen, a "jacket and tie" standard is appropriate, with an equivalent standard of eveningwear for ladies.</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Bring comfortable walking shoes with low or no heels. An umbrella or light raincoat may come in handy. Pack a swimming suit, as some hotels have pools. Cathedrals, churches and other religious sites require conservative dress. Both sexes should cover their arms, legs and shoulders.</p>
</div>

<div id="tab6" style="display:none;">
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;	For up to date information on latest health and vaccination recommendations, please contact your doctor.</p>
</div>
<div id="tab7" style="display:none;">
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Electrical service in Italy is supplied at 220-240 volts/50 hertz.</p>
</div>
<div id="tab8" style="display:none;">
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;	In general you should have a signed, valid passport that will remain valid for at least 6 months beyond the completion of your trip. Your passport must have enough blank pages (excluding amendment pages) available for entry and exit stamps issued when entering and exiting immigration points.</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Visas are required for certain nationalities and you are strongly advised to check your status allowing plenty of time for visa application.</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Croatia Departure Formalities: Authorities in Croatia will ask to see your passport and may ask to see the receipts from your purchases in Croatia. Be sure to keep these handy to show Customs officials as you depart. Croatia limits the amount of local currency you can take out of the country to 2000 kuna. As with most countries, Croatia forbids the export of "national treasures." Generally, trade in bona fide antiques is illegal and buyers are open to prosecution.
</p>
</div>
<div id="tab9" style="display:none;">
<p>&bull; &nbsp;&nbsp;	On-going construction projects in Romeincluding expansion of the subway system, restoration of monuments and parks landscapingare currently having an effect on traffic and visitor access. Some sightseeing stops now limit access by vehicle; some views are obstructed; and other minor inconveniences are in place. Some additional walking may be necessary when vehicles are required to disembark passengers at points more distant from site entrances. Scheduled sightseeing may have to be altered to accommodate changes in accessibility. We ask for your patience should such a situation occur.
