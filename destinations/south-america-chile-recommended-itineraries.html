<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 9 days</p>
<p>The perfect introduction to Chile - begin your exploration in the vibrant capital city of Santiago before visiting volcanoes, lakes and forests.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong> Santiago, Temuco, Villarrica, Calama, Atacama.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>ARRIVE SANTIAGO</h5>
<p>Upon arrival in Chile's capital city, you are met by your local representative for transfer to your hotel. Formerly Hyatt Regency Santiago, Hyatt's flagship property in South America, Grand Hyatt Santiago brings a fresh and modern look to a city that has evolved into a major destination.</p>
<p>
This afternoon, enjoy a city tour beginning with a visit to the neo-classical La Moneda Palace, home of Chilean presidents until 1958 and today the seat of the government. Also visit the Pre-Columbian Art Museum, one of South America's finest museums with exhibits of pre-Columbian cultures from Central America to the Andean region.</p>
<p>
Next, visit one of the most complete collections of ceramics, ancient textiles and relics of the American culture. After this interesting visit, walk with your guide to the heart of Santiago and to the recently remodelled Plaza de Armas. From here view the Cathedral (finished in 1789) and the buildings housing the Central Post Office and City Hall, both national monuments of colonial vintage.</p>
<p>
Also visit San Cristobal Hill with its impressive panorama of the city, nestled in a mountain valley. On its 1,145 foot crest stands the huge statue of the Virgin which is beautifully floodlit at night.</p>
<p>
Welcome dinner at the superb restaurant Puerto Fuy this evening.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Grand Hyatt Santiago<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>SANTIAGO</h5>
<p>You are collected from your hotel this morning for a full day tour of the winelands.</p>
<p>
To the south of Santiago there are important vineyards whose soil and climate produce wine of the highest quality, the best known of which is Concha y Toro. Vast fields of grapevines of the purest French ancestry exist, because Chile was one of the very few countries not affected by the worldwide plague of philoxera in 1863. This along with an ideal climate and significant investment over the last two decades has made Chilean wine some of the best wines in the world today.</p>
<p>
Viña Concha y Toro was founded in 1883 at Pirque, in the Maipo Valley, by the Spanish nobleman Don Melchor de Concha y Toro. Your visit begins in the Plaza Don Melchor square where you will be welcomed by your expert guide who will lead you to a balcony for a spectacular panoramic view of the Pirque vineyard. Glass of Casillero del Diablo white wine in hand, you can immerse yourself in the aromas and flavours of this centennial setting. You can stroll through the dense parkland and gardens that have been maintained as they were in the days of Don Melchor. The old casona will also be visited, the former residence of the Concha y Toro family. It was here that, over a hundred years ago, the biggest wine making company in Chile was born.
</p>
<p>Continue to Viña Santa Rita to enjoy a traditional lunch at restaurant Doña Paula. After lunch, tour around the vineyard. Santa Rita is one of the main wineries in the Maipo Valley, located in the town of Alto Jahuel, at the Andes foothills. The Mediterranean climate, with warm, dry summers and an average rainfall of 330 mm per year, has given this area recognition as being one of the best grape growing areas in the world, especially for Cabernet Sauvignon. </p>
<p>Return to Santiago and your hotel. Evening at leisure.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Grand Hyatt Santiago<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>SANTIAGO - TEMUCO - VILLARRICA</h5>
<p>Morning transfer to the airport for your flight to Temuco. Upon arrival in Temuco, you are met and transferred to your hotel, the excellent Villarrica Park Lake. </p>
<p>
Included in the transfer to Villarrica will be a visit to the Hueche Ruka community, giving you a fascinating insight into the traditions of the Mapuche peoples of Chile's south. These native people were here in the south of Chile long before the conquistador Pedro de Valdivia discovered the region in the mid 1500s. There will be a demonstration of the community's principal artistic and creative activities, its gastronomy and handicrafts. Continue to Villarrica, which lies in the shadow of the beautiful Villarrica Volcano on the eastern side of Lake Villarrica.</p>
<p>
Dinner will be served at the hotel's restaurant.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Villarrica Park Lake<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>VILLARRICA</h5>
<p>Your first full day in Chile's Lake District. 700 miles south of Santiago the crystal waters, lush green forests, rapids and waterfalls, snow-capped volcanoes and azure blue skies of the Chilean Lake District make this one of the world's scenic jewels.</p>
<p>
The city of Villarrica was founded by Geronimo de Alderete in 1552. Located at the edge of the lake Villarrica, it is surrounded by the snow-capped cone of the active Villarrica Volcano (2,700 metres above the lake). Pucón is Villarrica's more modern neighbour. A lively town with many options for the visitor, it is now regarded as Chile's active adventure capital.</p>
<p>
Morning visit to Pucón and surroundings, including the volcanic caves of the Villarrica Volcano. Discover the exciting sensation of entering one of only two volcanic caves open to visitors in the world. There will be a descent of 300 metres in order to observe their geological constitution. Set upon the volcano's hillsides, at 2,847 metres above sea level (8,540 feet), is the most important ski centre in the region, offering a wonderful view of the valley and lakes during the sunny days. Return to Pucón and enjoy lunch at a local restaurant.</p>
<p>Remainder of the day is at leisure to relax and enjoy the numerous facilities inside the hotel.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Villarrica Park Lake<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>VILLARRICA</h5>
<p>An early start this morning to visit the Huerquehue National Park, a mountainous 12,500 hectare (30,900 acre) natural reserve, located a short drive from Villarrica.</p>
<p>
The park offers a wide variety of hikes that traverse dense beech forests containing native vegetation such as coigües, lingues, and araucarias. Araucarias are unique old-growth trees that live for more than a thousand years. The araucaria is known as the Tree of the Mapuches because its Pehuén seed has sustained the Mapuche people for generations.</p>
<p>
The hiking paths in Huerquehue National Park lead to pleasant waterfalls and gurgling brooks, or to splendid vistas of the Andes and Volcano Villarrica. Enjoy the evening at leisure to relax and enjoy the numerous facilities inside the hotel.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Villarrica Park Lake<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>VILLARRICA - TEMUCO -SANTIAGO - CALAMA - ATACAMA</h5>
<p> After breakfast, transfer to the airport in Temuco to board your return flight to Santiago. Upon arrival you will be met by your local representative, who will assist you with your connecting flight to Calama.</p>
 <p>
At an altitude of 7,900 feet in the very heart of the Atacama, Calama is your gateway to the geological and archaeological wonders of the central desert.  Upon arrival in this oasis town, you will be transferred overland to the desert in Atacama. This is the world's driest landscape, cut off from storm systems by high-pressure air currents and by Chile's twin mountain ranges. No precipitation has been recorded here since the days of Spanish colonisation, four hundred years ago. Upon arrival at the hotel, you will enjoy a welcome drink, and are then free to wander around the premises.</p>
<p>Dinner at the hotel. During this evening, the guides will assist and suggest the options of activities available to do the following day.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Hotel Awasi<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,D</p>
</li>

<li>
<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>ATACAMA</h5>
<p>You have two full days to enjoy daily explorations accompanied by experienced guides in your private 4x4 vehicle.

<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 10 days</p>
<p>With the heat of the deserts in the north and the cold of the glaciers in the south, Chile is known as the Land of Fire and Ice. Santiago is the starting point for a fascinating journey in this land of extremes.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong> Santiago, Punta Arenas, Torres del Paine, Calama, San Pedro de Atacama</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>ARRIVE SANTIAGO</h5>
<p>Upon arrival to Chile's capital city, you will be met by your local representative. You will then be escorted to your waiting vehicle for the transfer to the hotel.</p>
<p>
In the afternoon you will be taken on an introductory tour of Santiago. This comprehensive tour begins with a visit to the neoclassical La Moneda Palace, home of Chilean presidents until 1958 and today the seat of the government. Also visit the Pre-Columbian Art Museum, one of South America's finest museuma with exhibits of pre-Columbian cultures from Central America to the Andean region.</p>
<p>
Stop for a comprehensive visit of one of the most complete collections of ceramics, ancient textiles and relics of the American culture. After this interesting visit, walk with your guide to the heart of Santiago and to the recently remodeled Plaza de Armas, from here view the Cathedral (finished in 1789) and the buildings housing the Central Post Office and City Hall, both national monuments of colonial vintage. Also visit the conical San Cristobal Hill with an impressive panorama of the city, nestled in its mountain valley, this wonderful view will be accompanied by exquisite Chilean wines.  On its 1145 foot crest stands the huge statue of the Virgin, beautifully floodlit at night.</p>

Upon arrival in Punta Arenas, you will be met by a local  representative who will assist you to your Explora Van, which will drive across windswept plains to the spectacular Torres del Paine National Park, a drive of about five-and-a half-hours. </p>
<p>
One of South America's newest nature reserves, the Paine was created in 1959, with the last addition to its acreage in the early 1970s. Famous for its glaciers, lakes and forests, this rugged region is also home to a wide variety of animal species, including guanaco (a relative of the llama), condors and flamingos. You will stay at the beautiful Explora Lodge, located in the park itself. Settle in and prepare to explore this spectacular landscape on foot, by boat, on horseback or in vans: the choice is yours.

Perhaps you'll start one morning with a drive to Lago Grey, where a short walk along Lagoon Beach offers an opportunity to photograph icebergs from shore, followed by a boat excursion for a closer examination at these "cathedrals of ice" and the glaciers that share their landscape. Or perhaps you would prefer a day on the hiking trails, one of the best ways to become acquainted with the snowy peaks, turquoise lakes and flowery slopes of this rich landscape.  Head for the hills and a panoramic view of waterfalls and forests.  Cross the river by rowboat to hike the French Valley framed by snow-capped glaciers.

<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong>  5 days </p>
<p>Explore the mysterious Easter Island, or Rapa Nui, a Polynesian island which is a special territory of Chile. Famous for its monumental statues, moai, this is the most isolated place on the planet.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong> Santiago, Easter Island.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>ARRIVE SANTIAGO - EASTER ISLAND</h5>
<p>Morning departure from Santiago Airport to Easter Island. Arrival at Mataveri Airport, where you will be met and transferred to the hotel.</p>
<p>
Discovered in 1771 on Easter Sunday (hence the name), Easter Island is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the most isolated place on the face of the Earth. The island lies at a distance of 3,700 km (2,300 miles) from the nearest populated point, which is the Chilean mainland. Although more Polynesian than South American in character, the 64 square mile island was annexed by Chile in 1888, and is now famous as the world's largest open air museum on account of the more than 600 Moai, or human-like stone statues, that can be found on the island. The Moai remain very much a mystery which archaeologists are still trying to unlock by interpreting an ancient language of the Rapa Nui. However, its unique characters that run left-to-right one line and then the reverse on the next line are still undecipherable.</p>
<p>
The island owes its origin to three volcanoes which erupted some three million years ago: Poike, Rano Kau and Maunga Terevaka. It is not known when or how the island was first populated, but the most credible theory suggests that the Rapa Nui people came from other Pacific islands in the 4th century AD.  In addition to the cultural and archaeological interest, there are the beautiful beaches, transparent waters and coral reefs that might be expected of a Pacific Island, and Jacques Cousteau himself agreed that it is one of the most perfect places for underwater marine studies.</p>
<p>
Dinner will be served at the hotel.</p>

<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>EASTER ISLAND</h5>
<p>Morning at leisure to enjoy the activities offered by the hotel.</p>
<p>
After lunch, you will be invited to see the island in a different perspective accompanied by your experienced guide Mr José Letelier who is involved in tourism related activities as well as consulting on several architectural monument and environmental conservation projects. At the end of the tour, you will be invited to have a drink and celebrate the end of this experience with the Moais.</p>
<p>
Ahu Tahai is a site that was restored in 1967 by archaeologist William Mulloy, and is one of the oldest on Easter Island. Although the name "Tahai" is used generally to describe the site, it does in fact include three different ahu (temples). The moai on Ahu Ko Te Riku, stands 4.73 meters high, and has an estimated weight of 20 tons. Ahu Vai Ure holds five different statues, and on Ahu Tahai stands one lone figure. As a special treat you will enjoy a champagne sundowner at this remarkable location. With moais and palm trees in the foreground, and glass of champagne in-hand, this will be a memorable evening in Rapa Nui.</p>
<p>
The key to understanding the history, myths and legends of Easter Island is surely meeting the people. The programme will include the unique opportunity of dining at the home of a local family providing an unforgettable experience and true insight into everyday life on the island.</p>

Once aloft, the balloon floats gently over the plains, giving a bird's eye view of the game below as the sun creeps slowly over the horizon. After around one hour the balloon lands as breakfast is already being prepared and, of course, enjoy a glass or two of bubbly to toast your flight in a tradition initiated by the Montgolfier brothers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lake Victoria Adventure : An early start this morning with a transfer to the airstrip for a flight by light aircraft to Lake Victoria.
