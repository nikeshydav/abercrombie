<h3>Sanctuary Baines' Camp</h3>
<p><strong>Okavango Delta, Botswana<br />
5 luxury suites all elevated</strong></p>
<p>Sanctuary Baines' Camp is located on a huge private concession bordering the Moremi Game Reserve in the Okavango Delta, home to some of the most spectacular wildlife on Earth. This is Sanctuary's smallest and most intimate camp, with only five luxurious suites. Set in a grove of trees, and surrounded by papyrus beds, this low environmental impact camp has been built using commercially grown wood and recycled tin cans. The local community in Maun was invited to collect as many cans as possible, a fee was paid for every can collected. The cans were then incorporated into the camp buildings, forming the backbone of the structures. </p>
<p>The camp has a lovely central swimming pool and the wide wooden deck that surrounds the main dining and sitting room is the ideal place to relax while observing the varied wildlife present here. See prowling lions on the hunt for prey at the edge of the lagoon which the camp overlooks, or watch the many elephants who live in the area. The five suites at Sanctuary Baines' have en suite facilities and four-poster beds swathed in mosquito netting. Traditional ceiling fans create a cooling breeze at even the hottest times of the year. Should you wish, your bed can be wheeled out onto the private wooden deck for a night under the stars, overlooking the shimmering waters of the Boro River where hippo can often be spotted as well as heard. </p>
<p>Activities include: day and night game drives by open 4WD safari vehicle, walking safaris, mokoro and motorboat excursions (seasonal) and the Elephant Experience.</p>

<h3>Sanctuary Chief's Camp</h3>
<p><strong>Moremi Game Reserve, Botswana<br />
12 luxury bush pavilions</strong></p>
<p>The 12 luxury bush pavilions at Sanctuary Chief's Camp are tucked away in the Mombo Concession, part of the world-renowned Moremi Game Reserve. This area is known as the 'predator capital of Africa' and is also home to large herds of elephant and buffalo, making Sanctuary Chief's the ideal place to experience African wildlife at close hand.  The camp is located on Chief's Island, one of the many islands created by the seasonal floodwaters of the Okavango. The island was named after Chief Moremi, the hereditary king of the area who used the lands as his royal hunting grounds. It was Moremi's people, the Tawana, who turned it into a reserve where animals are now protected. </p>
<p>The guest pavilions are hidden away in a jackalberry and sausage tree woodland that is characteristic of the area. All have their own private decks and indoor and outdoor showers. Generously draped mosquito nets and traditional ceiling fans also feature. There is a communal decked living room with stunning views over the floodplains, while the dining area surrounds a fire pit on the very edge of the Piajio plains so that guests can continue their game viewing while enjoying fine cuisine and wines. </p>
<p>Sanctuary Chief's has been designed with consideration for the environment - all rubbish is taken outside the park for responsible disposal and the whole camp can be removed without anyone knowing it was ever there. </p>
<p>Activities include: game drives by open 4WD safari vehicle and mokoro excursions (seasonal).</p>

Each cottage has its own private garden where guests can sip cocktails after a day of game viewing, or why not enjoy your very own private dinner served under the African sky.</p>

<h3>Sanctuary Stanley's Camp</h3>
<p><strong>Okavango Delta<br />
8 classically styled safari tents</strong></p>
<p>Sanctuary Stanley's is a classic tented camp with just eight tents built around an imposing sausage tree on a private concession overlooking the Okavango floodplains. The area around the camp changes with the seasons - from lush green when the rain flows down from the Angolan highlands to dry savannah when the Kalahari Desert tightens its grip.</p>
<p>This intimate camp is gathered around a large sitting and dining area which affords magnificent views over the floodplains of the Okavango Delta. From the swimming pool, watch giraffe and other plains game march across the savannah. You might even catch a glimpse of rare wild dogs stalking the plains. This is one of the best places in the world for seeing buffalo in large numbers, with herds often exceeding 2,000.</p>
<p>Each canvas tent at Sanctuary Stanley's boasts a traditional ceiling fan and is individually designed, but all have a classic and understated elegance that harks back to the explorers and colonialists of the 19th century. Large wooden decks provide private areas for guests to relax in hammocks or enjoy cocktails before dinner in the spectacular dining mess. </p>
<p>Activities include: game drives by open 4WD safari vehicles, walking safaris, mokoro excursions (seasonal) and the Elephant Experience.</p>
