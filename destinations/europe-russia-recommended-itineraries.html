<<<<<<< .mine
Leave your hotel early morning to visit one of the most interesting and most active volcanoes of South Kamchatka. By 6WD vehicle you�ll be taken to Gorely Volcano caldera.<br /><br />
The collapse of an ancient shield volcano triggered massive eruptions and as a result some craters merged with each other and today form a remarkable massif that arises in the center of the 13 kilometers long caldera. Even though Gorely is only 1829 meters high, it�s hiding 11 craters of different shape and size on the apical part. Some of them are filled with multicolored lakes, the others are covered with snow and ice while the Active Crater Lake is boiling and fuming.<br /><br />
It�ll take you about 5 hours to climb up to the crater and return back.

Visit the adjacent Maasai village, take a morning bush walk with an armed ranger or enjoy sundowners in the evening or even dinner under the stars in the middle of the African bush.<br /><br />In the Mara, the wildlife is abundant and the swaying grasslands ensure that animals are never out of sight. Elephants browse amongst the large herds of wildebeest, topi, gazelle, eland and buffalo. The plains offer a rich variety of food for the dominant predators: lion, leopard, hyena and cheetah. In the Mara River, hippos submerge while crocodiles sunbathe on the riverbanks.<br /><br />Around July to September, rain depending, the Masai Mara is host to the famous wildebeest migration which is one of the few remaining mass migrations of mammals in the world. During this time herds of over a million wildebeest will trawl their way through this region and they become the major focus for predatory activity and drama unfolds at every corner.<br /><br />There are also options for a morning balloon safari or a half-day visit to Lake Victoria.<br /><br />Balloon Safari: As the balloon is inflated against the first rays of sunrise your pilot will go through safety procedures. Once aloft, the balloon floats gently over the plains, giving a bird's eye view of the game below as the sun creeps slowly over the horizon. After around one hour the balloon lands as breakfast is already being prepared and, of course, enjoy a glass or two of bubbly to toast your flight in a tradition initiated by the Montgolfier brothers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lake Victoria Adventure : An early start this morning with a transfer to the airstrip for a flight by light aircraft to Lake Victoria. On arrival enjoy an appetising full English breakfast before you board the boat for the morning. There will be the opportunity to try fishing for the legendary giant Nile perch found in these waters as you explore the myriad of tiny islands in this region of the lake. An experienced and knowledgeable fisherman captains each boat. There is the chance to stop at a traditional fishing village and see how the villagers live from day to day before returning to the airstrip for your return flight to the Masai Mara.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p>";

</li>
<li>

Following lunch at leisure your private vehicle and English-speaking guide will take you to magnificent Red Square with its famous landmark, the colourful domed St. Basil's Cathedral. Afterwards visit the Novodevichy Convent complex. Founded in 1584, this magnificent building has 16 gilded domes.

<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Hotel Ritz Carlton or Baltschug Kempinski<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>Moscow - Sergeiv Posad - Rostov - Yaroslavl</h5>
<p>Early this morning you leave Moscow behind as you venture into the countryside with your private vehicle and English-speaking guide to Yaroslavl. En route you will stop in Sergiev Posad, still commonly referred by its Soviet name of 'Zagorsk'. This is one of Russia's most important religious and historical landmarks. You will visit the Trinity Monastery of St Sergius and its opulent treasury. For 500 years, this was the most important place of pilgrimage in Russia. Continue to Rostov the Great. Rostov the Great was first mentioned in the ancient chronicles in the year 862 and its 17th century Kremlin is a pearl of Russian architecture. Rostov the Great has been known as the centre of enamel arts since the 17th century and the Kremlin's museum houses a special collection dating back to the 18th century. After lunch at leisure continue to
Yaroslavl where you will stay overnight.</p>

<strong>Overnight:</strong> Hotel Ring Premier<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>

<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>Yaroslavl - Kostroma</h5>
<p>
Start your morning with a sightseeing tour of Yaroslavl. Yaroslavl is the oldest city on the Volga River. It remained unharmed during World War II
and many churches from the 13th to the 17th centuries are still intact. See the Saviour Transfiguration Monastery, adorned with murals depicting
Saint John's apocalyptic visions. You may also visit the "Treasures of Yaroslavl" exhibition in the monastery grounds, which features precious

<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>KOSTROMA - SUZDAL</h5>
<p>
Start your morning with a sightseeing tour in Kostroma. Kostroma is a historic city in central Russia located on the left bank of the Volga River.
First mentioned in chronicles in 1237, Kostroma was founded somewhat earlier by pagan Slavs. In the 17th century young Michael Romanov
accepted the Russian throne from his place of hiding in Kostroma's Ipatievsky monastery. It is understandable why the Romanov Tsars regarded
Kostroma as their special protectorate. The Ipatievsky monastery was visited by many of them, including Nicholas II, the last Russian Tsar. The monastery had been founded in the early 14th century by a Tatar prince, ancestor of the Godunov family. Another popular destination in Kostroma is the open-air Museum of Wooden Architecture. Here amidst picturesque streams and woods stands a variety of hand crafted
wooden structures from around the Kostroma region. Small churches, barns, windmills, boathouses, and a series of peasant dwellings ranging from the modest to the opulent are open for your inspection. After lunch at leisure continue to Suzdal where you stay for overnight.</p>

<h5>SUZDAL - VLADIMIR - SUZDAL</h5>

<p>
After lunch at leisure continue to Vladimir, stoping en route in Bogolubovo. Vladimir was founded by Vladimir Monamakh, Grand Prince of Kiev, in
1108 as a fort in the Rostov-Suzdal municipality. The most significant building made during his reign is the stunning 12th century Cathedral of the
Assumption which houses frescoes by the greatest of old Russian painters, Andrei Rubylov. You may also like to visit the Museum of Cut Glass
and Lacquered Miniatures.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Nikolaevsky Posad Hotel<br />

The Serengeti perhaps defines the safari experience as surely as the wildlife that inhabits it. Established in 1951, and covering an area of almost 15,000 sq km, an area comparable to the state of Connecticut or Northern Ireland, the Serengeti hosts a fantastically diverse ecosystem. The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, where 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other plains game that follow close behind, make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";

The Ngorongoro Crater is the largest unbroken caldera in the world and the first sight of it is breathtaking.<br /><br />Ngorongoro Crater Lodge is situated on the edge of the ancient crater rim above the cool, swirling mists. The lodge is a return to the noble elegance of the travelling colonials.

Rhinos can often be seen with calves at heel. Eland and waterbuck appear not to notice the human visitors, enabling photographers to shoot at ease.
