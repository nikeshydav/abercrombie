<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Melbourne</h5>
<p>After breakfast this morning you will be met by your driver and transferred by private vehicle an hour & a half out of the city to rural Victoria. Today is a real treat - an exclusive experience - where you are welcomed into the home of the Barber family, to learn a little of what it is like to be an Aussie family 'living off the land'. This is a genuine operating sheep property which has been in the Barber Family name since 1917. The magnificent 6500 acre property is located approx 90 minutes from Melbourne. Meet Duncan Barber a 4th generation farmer of this land and enjoy an exclusive visit to his sheep farm.</p>

<p>
After morning tea, it is time for you to watch as Duncan shears a sheep. Within the confines of this historic woolshed built in 1944, you will learn more about the wool industry and the rich 150 year history which can be traced back to the Elector of Saxony. The finer details of preparing and classing a fleece and the process a fleece goes through will be detailed, and this beautiful product that ends up as fabric made into Italy's finest men's suits (Zegna) is sure to impress and enthral. This is also a chance to watch Duncan work his Australian Sheep Dogs & to plant an Australian Native Tree to commemorate your visit to the property before returning to the homestead for a three course lunch with the Barber family. Your lunch will include Australian wine, beer and water.</p>
<p>
To conclude your day, Duncan will take you for a drive around the property to spot kangaroos in their natural environment before you re-join the vehicle and journey back to Melbourne.

'The Rock' is 8.8 kilometres around the base, 3.6 kilometres long, 2.4 kilometres wide and towers 348 metres above the surrounding plain. The Anangu people believe they are the direct descendents of the ancestral spirits who gave them the laws and rules that they live by. They believe they are responsible for the protection of the lands and ask visitors to respect their wishes not to climb the rock. Its significant power can be felt particularly in the early morning or at sunset as the Rock undergoes an extraordinary transformation of colour.</p>

<h4>Day 14</h4>
<h5>Sydney</h5>
<p>After breakfast this morning meet your guide in the hotel lobby for your morning sightseeing tour of the harbour city. Today's tour begins at Sydney's historic Rocks area known for its narrow cobbled streets and convict buildings. Continue past the historic Mint and Hyde Park Barracks and stop at Mrs Macquarie's Chair for wonderful views of the Harbour, Opera House and Harbour Bridge. From here journey on by private vehicle to the Sydney Opera House for a private, behind-the-scene's tour of this Australian icon.</p>
<p>
50 years ago a young Danish architect named Jorn Utzon dreaming of Bennelong Point, designed a masterpiece which pushed the boundaries of creativity and science - and put Sydney on the map forever. Step inside the world's most recognizable sails for a one hour tour and experience the miracle of architecture and engineering. A work of art that came into existence against impossible odds - to become one of the busiest performing arts centres in the world! Working with a new enriching interactive and audio visual component, where images are projected onto the fabric of the building - our guides will take you on an emotional journey, engrossing you in a story to rival any opera plot with its dramatic twists and turns.</p>
<p>
You'll visit one of the major venues - where there are live performances every day. Some 1500 performances, in every genre you can imagine, are staged each year to audiences of around one million.</p>
<p>
From here your guide will escort you along Circular Quay to Campbell's Cove pontoon where your vessel awaits. This afternoon you will be orientated with Sydney from the most enviable vantage point - on the water! Cruising on Sydney Harbour is a quintessential Australian experience, and today you will experience 'Calypso' - a 52 foot motor cruiser with a minimum of two and a maximum of ten guests onboard.</p>
<p>
Whilst cruising this iconic harbour you will have the opportunity to swim, fish or kayak. However most choose to sit back with a glass of Australian beer or wine & take in the amazing sights - the Harbour Bridge, the Opera House, Luna Park, Fort Denison and the waterfront homes of the rich & famous. A barbeque lunch is served on board, while anchored in a secluded cove. And as the afternoon sun comes in we suggest making your way to the bow and settling in the sunbeds for the perfect views of the harbour city as you come back in to moor. Your 4 hour experience on the water ends at Campbell's Cove pontoon, just a short walk from your hotel.</p>
<p>
For dinner this evening we recommend a restaurant reservation at Aria or Icebergs at Bondi</p>

Whether this is your first time on safari or a return trip the Serengeti will not disappoint.<br /><br />The Serengeti National Park is arguably the most famous national park in the world. The Serengeti perhaps defines the safari experience as surely as the wildlife that inhabits it. Established in 1951, and covering an area of almost 15,000 sq km, an area comparable to the state of Connecticut or Northern Ireland, the Serengeti hosts a fantastically diverse ecosystem. The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, where 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other plains game that follow close behind, make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";

The Selous supports around one million game animals, is bigger than Switzerland and is a World Heritage site.

The Ngorongoro Crater is the largest unbroken caldera in the world and the first sight of it is breathtaking.<br /><br />Ngorongoro Crater Lodge is situated on the edge of the ancient crater rim above the cool, swirling mists. The lodge is a return to the noble elegance of the travelling colonials. Inspired in design by the Maasai Manyatta, three separate camps of 6 to 12 suites each remember a bygone era when characters such as Lord Delamere adorned the stilted, handcrafted structures with graceful antiques, grand chandeliers and treasures collected from travels through Africa.<br /><br /></p>";

From your lodge on the crater rim descend to the crater floor by 4WD safari vehicle for a morning unlike any other you will experience in Africa. Spot some of the rarer species in Africa like the black rhino against the spectacular backdrop of the crater's forest covered walls. Enjoy a picnic lunch amongst the hippos and birds before visiting a Maasai village this afternoon.<br /><br />The floor of the crater is only 100 sq miles but is home to around 30,000 animals with a high concentration of predators and some of the finest black-maned lions in Africa. Rhinos can often be seen with calves at heel. Eland and waterbuck appear not to notice the human visitors, enabling photographers to shoot at ease. On the lake in the middle of the crater you may see thousands of flamingos fluttering and shimmering like a pink heat haze. Zebra and wildebeest account for almost half the animals. Gazelle, buffalo, eland, hartebeest and wart hog can also be seen.<br /></p>";

The camp offers spectacular views across Tortillis woodland situated on the edge of the short grass plains. The camp is comprised of nine double tents scattered around the kopje with the mess tent and common area as the central feature. Privacy between tents is guaranteed as they are at a substantial distance from each other and are generally concealed by a tree or kopje.<br /></p>";
