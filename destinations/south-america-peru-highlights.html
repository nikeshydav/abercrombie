<dt><h2>Lima</h2> 
<p>Devour the stunning pre-Hispanic and colonial architecture and charms of Lima, the capital city of Peru. Lima was named <em>Ciudad de los Reyes</em> or the City of Kings in 1535 and currently is the fourth largest metrópolis in the Americas!</p>
<div class="thepet"><p>Lima is characterized by its glorious past, cultural heritage, archeological sites, vibrant nightlife, museums, art galleries, festivals, and traditions. The Historic Centre of Lima has been listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO where one can admire colonial structures and churches. Visitors can also get an exclusive bird's eye view of Nazca Lines from the skies of the nearby Ica city.</p>

<dt><h2>Cusco</h2> 
<p>The history of Cusco goes back to nearly three millenniums. The ancient city has been the capital of the remarkable Empire of the Inca civilization and presently enjoys the status of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The modern city of Cusco is a coalition of Andean-Hispanic cultures where one can explore extraordinary Inca and pre-Incan architecture, along with the colonial influenced landmarks such as La Compania Church.</p>
<div class="thepet"><p>Remarkable monuments such as Sacsayhuaman have been standing for centuries in these complexes. Among other Inca structures waiting to be discovered are the Koricancha, Temple of the Sun, the palace of Inca Roca and the fortress of Puca Pucará. Cusco is also the gateway to Inca Trails, Peru's most famous hiking route spanning nearly 23,000 kms. In fact Machu Picchu and Sacred Valley of the Incas is also located conveniently close to the city. </p>

<dt><h2>The Sacred Valley</h2> 
<p>Lying only 15 kms north to Cusco and below the ancient city Machu Picchu is the Sacred Valley of the Incas, also known as Urubamba Valley.  The primeval valley was truly a key region for the Inca civilization settlement owing to its favorable climate and fertile plains surrounded by the Andes ranges. </p>
<div class="thepet"><p> 
Today visitors can soak in the local vibes at the charming villages such as Pisac and Chincheros and get a slice of Peruvian rural life as well as visit the majestic ruins of Ollantaytambo fortress. If you're looking for something different from the historical tourism, then you can always take a different route and go hiking, rafting, cycling or horseback riding.

<dt><h2>Machu Picchu</h2> 
<p>Machu Picchu is truly a testimonial to divinity where the visitors feel enveloped by a sense of spirituality and mysticism of its remarkable legacy left behind by the Incans. The archaeological site of Machu Picchu is considered as one of the New Seven Wonders in the World.</p>
<div class="thepet"><p>It is shaped like a citadel snuggled up in the Andean terraces, in the middle of a dry wood or high jungle. In its premises one can clearly witness the extensive yards or 'canchas' that remark the presence of the Incas' typical places, 'kallankas', warehouses, corridors, steps and accesses.</p>

<dt><h2>Lake Titicaca</h2> 
<p>Lake Titicaca is located on the border of Peru and Bolivia at an altitude of nearly 4000 metres. Often known as South America's largest lake, it used to be the concentration point of the formidable Tiawanaco culture that was thriving even before the Incan civilization. This lake is famous for Uros Islands, and was once the centre of formidable Tiawanaco culture. People often visit the island communities of Taquile and Amantani here.  </p>
<div class="thepet"><p>The history of the lake is surrounded my myths and legends. A Peruvian fable is that the first two Incas, Mama Ocllo and Manco Capac, rose from the lake's depths before they descended to Cusco and set the roots of the Inca Empire. Hence Titicaca is considered a sacred site by many even today.</p>

<dt><h2>The Amazon</h2> 
<p>Peru is home to nearly 13% of the Amazon Rainforest which is located in the eastern part of the country. The Peruvian Amazon covers nearly 60% of the geographical region rendering it a remarkable biodiversity. Most of the Peruvian territory is covered by dense forest to the east of the Andes.  </p>
<div class="thepet">
<p>To the northern region of the rainforest the city of Iquitos acts as gateway to the Amazon basin, a former concentration of rubber boom of the early 20th century. Iquitos is also home to the majestic mansion, The Iron House architected by Mr. Gustave Eiffel, who also designed the world famous Eiffel Tower. </p>
<p>It also makes for a region rich with natural beauty and biodiversity which encourages ecotourism. Iquitos also offers a splendid opportunity for visitors to stay overnight in jungle lodges located in the dense jungle itself to experience the rawness of the nature around them intimately. The lush fertile forest is home to numerous species of mammals, birds and insects and vegetations and plants. One has to spare time to explore protected natural reserves such as Pacaya Samiria National Reserve or Allpahuayo Mishana Natural Reserve to complete their <strong>Peru Tourist places</strong> list. </p>
<p>In the south of Puerto Maldonado is reachable from Cusco and offers accommodation option in Northern Amazon. Travelers can visit Manu National Park, which is an incredible biodiversity hub which also has earned Puerto Maldonado and Tambopata as biological capital of the world.

<dt><h2>Arequipa & Colca</h2> 
<p>Arequipa is also known as the White City or Ciudad Blanca, thanks to its gorgeous colonial houses, churches and monasteries made out of unique indigenous white ashlars stones such as Santa Catalina.  Arequipa was a densely populated pre Hispanic region and even at present is the second most significant urban centre. The city showcases a blend of ancient and modern compositions and moreover its Historical Centre is recognized by the UNESCO as a Cultural World Heritage Site. </p>
<div class="thepet"><p>Arequipa also overlooks the majestic Misti Volcano which guards over the city for centuries. Across its widespread savannahs one can admire vicuna, a rare species of camelid. Visitors to this city may also visit the famous Colca Canyon belonging to the Colca River. The canyon is located northwest of Arequipa and twice as deep as the Grand Canyons of USA with the depth of over 4,000 metres. The world's deepest canyon is a gateway to the Colca Valley, which is a delightful mix of Andean landscape with pre-Inca stepped terraces and colonial towns with Spanish roots.</p>

<dt><h2>The Archaeological North</h2> 
<p>Peru, as a whole is teeming with archeological wonders from ancient mythical civilization. However it is the northern Peru, which possess a rich heritage with some of the most significant sites lying at its North Coast making it a must visit for <strong>sightseeing</strong>. <strong>Peru</strong> has been a concentration for pre historic cultures such as Mochica, Lambayeque or Sicán, Chimú long before the Incas had established their roots in the by 1470 AD. However, very little is known about these civilizations even today.</p>
<div class="thepet"><p>The North of Peru is a complex of coastal desert and Andean Highlands, which feature some of the oldest monumental architecture of the Andes. The adobe city of Chan Chan is one such archeological site covering approximately 20 sqkm listed in UNESCO World Heritage Site. An even more precious treasure trove awaits just outside Chiclayo, housing a tomb enclosing over 400 jewels belonging to the mythical Lord of Sipan. For history or archeology enthusiasts, sites such as Cajamarca, Chachapoyan ruins of Kuelap remain the most irresistible destinations to explore.</p>
