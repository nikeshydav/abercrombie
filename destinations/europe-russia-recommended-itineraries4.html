<h1>A New Year Celebration at the Tsar's Ball in St Petersburg</h1>
<div class="popupbanner"><img src="../images/europe_russia1.jpg" alt="Russia" /><img src="../images/banner-bottom-shadow.gif" alt="Banner" /></div>

<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 6 days</p>
<p>Experience New Year somewhere different with this 6-day itinerary showcasing St Petersburg's highlights and the spectacular New Year Tsar's
Ball.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong>St Petersburg, Hermitage, Yusupov Palace, Pavlovsk Palace, Troika Ride, Tsar's New Year Ball at Catherine Palace, tea with a
local Russian family, Russian Museum, Mariinsky Theatre backstage tour.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>Arrive St Petersburg - 29th December</h5>
<p>Upon arrival at St Petersburg airport you will be met in the arrivals hall by your guide and privately transferred to your luxurious hotel in the city
centre where your Guardian Angel will assist you with check-in.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Grand Hotel Europe</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>St Petersburg: Hermitage with Gold Room, Yusupov Palace - 30th December</h5>
<p>The Hermitage museum is situated in the lavishly decorated Winter Palace and occupies six magnificent buildings with three million pieces of
artwork from the Stone Age to modern times. The main building and largest part of the museum is the rococo-style Winter Palace, residence of
the Czars from 1762 to 1917. The museum was commissioned by Catherine the Great and she and her successors built the Hermitage collection
in large part with purchases of private collections of the Western European aristocracy and monarchies. Visit the museum with your private guide
and also pay a special visit to the Gold Room and its exquisite collection of Scythian gold.</p>
<p>Enjoy lunch at leisure before visiting the opulent Yusupov Palace nearby, home to Russia’s wealthiest family before the revolution. As well as
visiting the beautiful state and private rooms (including the exotic Moorish Room) we will also visit the basement room where the ‘mad monk’
Rasputin was poisoned in 1916.</p>
<p>This evening you may wish to have dinner at one of the city’s finest restaurants. Your Guardian Angel will provide a list of recommended
restaurants and help you with the table reservation.</p>
<p>One of our preferred restaurants is the “Tsar”, located in a building with rich historical background, on Sadovaya St. 12. The eatery offers its
guests delicacies of Russian State royal cuisine. Looking at the menu, guests will be transported to the 19th-20th centuries, when some amazing
and unique dishes were considered standard cuisine for the daily Royal table.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Grand Hotel Europe <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>    
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>St Petersburg: Pavlovsk Palace with Troika horse ride, Tsar's Ball at Catherine Palace - 31st December</h5>
<p>Travel south out of St. Petersburg for a morning visit to Pavlosk Palace which remained a royal residence until 1917. Pavlosk’s park of
woodland, rivers, lakes, and classical statues is one of the most exquisite in Russia and the Great Palace is a classical contrast to Catherine’s
Palace. After a visit of the interior, you will enjoy a ride in a horse drawn troika, three horses will pull you along on a big carriage, colorfully
painted in a traditional Russian style. The fervent ring of the bells tied to a bridle will be your accompanying music.</p>
<p>Afterwards enjoy lunch at the lively country restaurant Podvorie Dacha, where President Putin has celebrated his birthday. Return to St.
Petersburg with time to prepare for the evening ahead.</p>
<p>This evening depart your hotel for unforgettable night at the Tsar’s Ball at Catherine Palace.</p>

have left their traces in Khiva, built over many centuries in the ancient cultural oasis of Khorasmia. Old Khiva is an entire city, constructed within
magnificent fortification walls with entrance gates. Its unique architectural complexes that include palaces, houses, public buildings and
mausolea, interspersed with original architecture such as the minarets of Islam-Khodja, Kalta-Minar and Tura-Murad-Tura, are a bright illustration
of the Muslim tradition, according to which buildings raised at different times constitute an ensemble. A number of Madrassahs from the 18th and
19th centuries reflect not only the skills of architects and builders but also the fact that Khiva was an important educational center.</p>

<p><strong>Meal Plan:</strong>B, L, D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 9</h4>
<h5>Full day - Bukhara</h5>
<p>Today spend a full day in Bukhara to experience its very special atmosphere.</p>
<p>The massive walls of the Ark Fortress dominate the old town area. Behind them are the elegant eiwans of the mosques and divans. There is also
the dark pit of Zindan, the prison, where two British officers were kept before being executed in the main square in June 1842. Opposite the Ark
is the elegant and fragile looking Bolo-Khauz Mosque, beautifully reflected in the pool in front of it.</p>
<p>In the centre of the old town is the Lyabi-Khauz Ensemble with the elegant buildings standing around the pool. Among them are: the Kukeldash
Madrassah (the 16th century), the Nodyr-Divan-Beghi Madrassah and Khanako (the 17th century). The buildings’ reflection in the pool and the
ancient trees around it create a special atmosphere of peace and solitude. Beyond the greenery of the park one can see the beautiful brick
lacework of the Ismail Samani Mausoleum (the 9th – 10th centuries) done in the style that predates the use of the glazed tiles. One can still drink
from the Prophet Job’s Well around which a Shrine was built in the 14th century.</p>
<p>Continue your exploration of the area and drive to the eastern suburbs of Bukhara to visit the Sitora-i-Mokhi-Khosa, the Summer Palace of the
last Emir, built in an intriguingly eclectic style, combining European and local elements. Its breathtaking Reception Hall decorated in carved
stucco and mirrors has become a model for the modern craftsmen of Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>Also visit the Boghoudin Nakshbandi Complex before proceeding to the Silk Road Tea house.</p>
<p>Enjoy lunch and dinner at a city restaurant.</p>

<p><strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B, L, D</p>
</li>

<li>
<h4>Day 10</h4>
<h5>Bukhara - Samarkand</h5>
<p>After breakfast drive to Samarkand (280 km, 4 hours). Arrive in time to check-in at your hotel and enjoy lunch at a city restaurant.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, follow your guide on an orientation tour of Samarkand – one of the world’s oldest cities, located in the very centre of Uzbekistan
in the valley of the Zeravshan River. It has seen periods of power and decline throughout its 2750-year history. The city was destroyed by
Alexander the Great, the Arabs, Genghis Khan and many other conquerors, but rose each time from the ashes like a Phoenix.</p>
<p>Samarkand was a capital of ancient Sogdiana, part of the huge Akhemenian Empire in the 4th century BC. In the 14th century when Tamerlane
made it his capital, Samarkand became one of the most powerful and desired cities in the world.</p>
<p>One can sense the old grandeur of the city glimpsing a view of Bibi Khanym Mosque (the 15th century) on the Northern side of the city, the
largest structure of its time in the world, standing beside a noisy and crowded oriental market full of colorful fruits, vegetables and fragrant spices
grown on Uzbek land. Visiting the harmonious Registan Square one can fully agree with Lord George Curzon – the Viceroy of India, who said:
“Registan in Samarkand is the best central city square in the world”.</p>
<p>Shah-i-Zinda, a big medieval burial complex (the 10th – to 20th centuries), often referred to as “the Street of the Dead”, gives a good idea of
Tamerlane’s intention to turn Samarkand into a collection of the world’s architectural styles.</p>

<p><strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B, L, D</p>
</li>

<li>
<h4>Day 11</h4>
<h5>Full day - Samarkand</h5>
<p>Today continue to explore Samarkand.</p>
<p>The The Gur-Emir Mausoleum (the 15th century), where Tamerlane is buried along with several sons and grandsons, is the most brilliant
example of medieval Central Asian architecture. It is reminiscent of the famous mosques of Cordova and Granada and was an inspiration for the
Great Moguls’ Taj Mahal in Agra.</p>
<p>Samarkand was also an important scientific centre, with scholars who influenced scientific work in other countries. Among them was Ulugbek,
Tamerlane’s grandson, the ruler of Samarkand. His observatory, built in 1429 – 30 in the northern suburbs of Samarkand, was a model for the
two famous Indian observatories of the 18th century in Jaipur and Delhi. The observatory has not survived, but an underground portion of its
enormous sextant still attracts the eye.</p>
<p>Finish your day with a visit to the “Khudjum” silk carpet factory.</p>

<p><strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B, L, D</p>
</li>

<li>
<h4>Day 12</h4>
<h5>Samarkand - Tashkent</h5>
<p>After breakfast drive to Tashkent (295 km, 4 hours) and check-in upon arrival.</p>
<p>After lunch in a local restaurant, explore Tashkent, the modern capital of the Republic of Uzbekistan. The city’s history spans over 2 millennia,
although few monuments from ancient times have survived here. Wars and natural calamities have swept most of the old buildings from the face
of the ancient city. Among the survivors are: the Kukeldash Madrassah (the 16th century), the Yunus Khan Mausoleum (the 15th century), the
Sheikhantaur Ensemble (the 15th century).</p>
<p>This afternoon you will also have the chance to experience a calligraphy master class.</p>
<p><strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B, L, D</p>
</li>
    
<li>
<h4>Day 13</h4>
<h5>Tashkent - Namangan</h5>
<p>Fly to Namangan this morning and transfer to Fergana via Margilan (110 km, 1,5 hour).</p>

Park and the History Museum.</p>
<p>Lunch and dinner will be in a city restaurant or your hotel in Fergana.</p>
<p><strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B, L, D</p>

<h4>Day 14</h4>
<h5>Fergana</h5>
<p>After breakfast in the hotel, travel to Rishtan for a city tour with a visit to the Rishtan ceramics centre.</p>
<p>Afterwards drive to Kokand – an ancient city of the Silk Way, where you may see the Madrassah of Norbut – Bii (the 18th cent.), the Djuma
Mosque (19th cent), the Dahmai – Sharon Mausoleum (14 – 15th cent.) and the Hudoyar Jhan Palace (17 – 19th cent.).</p>

Even though Gorely is only 1829 meters high, its hiding 11 craters of different shape and size on the apical part. Some of them are filled with multicolored lakes, the others are covered with snow and ice while the Active Crater Lake is boiling and fuming.<br /><br />
Itll take you about 5 hours to climb up to the crater and return back.

Serengeti is the home of the great wildebeest migration and the short grass plains around your accommodation provide the perfect setting for the wildebeest as they mass around the area during the birthing of their young in the early months of each year.<br /><br />Kusini is perfectly located in a private corner of the Serengeti and sited among a cluster of kopjes (beautiful outcrops of granite rock).&nbsp; Part of Kusini's charm is its remote and private location within the park borders and with no other camps in the near vicinity Kusini offers exceptional and essentially private game viewing.<br /></p>";

Visit the adjacent Maasai village, take a morning bush walk with an armed ranger or enjoy sundowners in the evening or even dinner under the stars in the middle of the African bush.<br /><br />In the Mara, the wildlife is abundant and the swaying grasslands ensure that animals are never out of sight. Elephants browse amongst the large herds of wildebeest, topi, gazelle, eland and buffalo. The plains offer a rich variety of food for the dominant predators: lion, leopard, hyena and cheetah. In the Mara River, hippos submerge while crocodiles sunbathe on the riverbanks.<br /><br />Around July to September, rain depending, the Masai Mara is host to the famous wildebeest migration which is one of the few remaining mass migrations of mammals in the world. During this time herds of over a million wildebeest will trawl their way through this region and they become the major focus for predatory activity and drama unfolds at every corner.<br /><br />There are also options for a morning balloon safari or a half-day visit to Lake Victoria.<br /><br />Balloon Safari: As the balloon is inflated against the first rays of sunrise your pilot will go through safety procedures. Once aloft, the balloon floats gently over the plains, giving a bird's eye view of the game below as the sun creeps slowly over the horizon. After around one hour the balloon lands as breakfast is already being prepared and, of course, enjoy a glass or two of bubbly to toast your flight in a tradition initiated by the Montgolfier brothers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lake Victoria Adventure : An early start this morning with a transfer to the airstrip for a flight by light aircraft to Lake Victoria. On arrival enjoy an appetising full English breakfast before you board the boat for the morning. There will be the opportunity to try fishing for the legendary giant Nile perch found in these waters as you explore the myriad of tiny islands in this region of the lake. An experienced and knowledgeable fisherman captains each boat.

<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>Moscow - Sergeiv Posad - Rostov - Yaroslavl</h5>
<p>Early this morning you leave Moscow behind as you venture into the countryside with your private vehicle and English-speaking guide to Yaroslavl. En route you will stop in Sergiev Posad, still commonly referred by its Soviet name of 'Zagorsk'. This is one of Russia's most important religious and historical landmarks. You will visit the Trinity Monastery of St Sergius and its opulent treasury. For 500 years, this was the most important place of pilgrimage in Russia. Continue to Rostov the Great. Rostov the Great was first mentioned in the ancient chronicles in the year 862 and its 17th century Kremlin is a pearl of Russian architecture. Rostov the Great has been known as the centre of enamel arts since the 17th century and the Kremlin's museum houses a special collection dating back to the 18th century. After lunch at leisure continue to
Yaroslavl where you will stay overnight.</p>

<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>Yaroslavl - Kostroma</h5>

and many churches from the 13th to the 17th centuries are still intact. See the Saviour Transfiguration Monastery, adorned with murals depicting
Saint John's apocalyptic visions. You may also visit the "Treasures of Yaroslavl" exhibition in the monastery grounds, which features precious

<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>KOSTROMA - SUZDAL</h5>
<p>
Start your morning with a sightseeing tour in Kostroma. Kostroma is a historic city in central Russia located on the left bank of the Volga River.
First mentioned in chronicles in 1237, Kostroma was founded somewhat earlier by pagan Slavs. In the 17th century young Michael Romanov
accepted the Russian throne from his place of hiding in Kostroma's Ipatievsky monastery. It is understandable why the Romanov Tsars regarded
Kostroma as their special protectorate. The Ipatievsky monastery was visited by many of them, including Nicholas II, the last Russian Tsar. The monastery had been founded in the early 14th century by a Tatar prince, ancestor of the Godunov family. Another popular destination in Kostroma is the open-air Museum of Wooden Architecture. Here amidst picturesque streams and woods stands a variety of hand crafted
wooden structures from around the Kostroma region. Small churches, barns, windmills, boathouses, and a series of peasant dwellings ranging from the modest to the opulent are open for your inspection. After lunch at leisure continue to Suzdal where you stay for overnight.</p>

<p>
After lunch at leisure continue to Vladimir, stoping en route in Bogolubovo. Vladimir was founded by Vladimir Monamakh, Grand Prince of Kiev, in
1108 as a fort in the Rostov-Suzdal municipality. The most significant building made during his reign is the stunning 12th century Cathedral of the
Assumption which houses frescoes by the greatest of old Russian painters, Andrei Rubylov. You may also like to visit the Museum of Cut Glass
and Lacquered Miniatures.</p>

The Serengeti perhaps defines the safari experience as surely as the wildlife that inhabits it. Established in 1951, and covering an area of almost 15,000 sq km, an area comparable to the state of Connecticut or Northern Ireland, the Serengeti hosts a fantastically diverse ecosystem. The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, where 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other plains game that follow close behind, make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";

The Ngorongoro Crater is the largest unbroken caldera in the world and the first sight of it is breathtaking.<br /><br />Ngorongoro Crater Lodge is situated on the edge of the ancient crater rim above the cool, swirling mists. The lodge is a return to the noble elegance of the travelling colonials.

Rhinos can often be seen with calves at heel. Eland and waterbuck appear not to notice the human visitors, enabling photographers to shoot at ease.
