<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong>   6 days</p>
<p>A gourmet tour of Santiago and surrounding areas, including visits to both well-known and up and coming wineries.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong> Santiago, Aconcagua Valley, San Antonio Valley, Maipo Valley, Colchagua Valley.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>ARRIVE SANTIAGO</h5>
<p>Upon arrival in Santiago, you will be met inside the Arrivals Hall by your guide who will assist with Immigration and Customs formalities, and luggage collection, before escorting you to your waiting vehicle for the direct transfer to your hotel. Once at the hotel your guide will assist with check-in.</p>
<p>
Once you have had time to relax and unwind following your flight, you will commence a unique exploration of Santiago. Sophie is a young Swedish woman, passionate about exploring the world and who during her travels fell in love with the country and decided to return to fulfil her dream of studying Spanish. Upon her return it was not long before she found a true reason to stay: Enrique, a Chilean chef, who was still in the process of unpacking his suitcases following a spell in the kitchens of several European restaurants. It was not too long before this charming couple decided to make plans to combine their interests in all things culinary and make their living by highlighting the culinary secrets of this fascinating and booming city Latin American metropolis. You will be met in the hotel by Sophie, and lead to your waiting vehicle for the short drive to a typical street market, passing en route some of the city's most iconic areas such as Bellavista, El Bosque or Borderío. Upon arrival to the market you will meet up with Enrique, and stroll past the colourful stalls, getting to know the wide variety of fruits and vegetables available. From here, continue to the couple's apartment where lunch will be prepared. Upon arrival you will be served an aperitif (such as the emblematic pisco sour) along with some appetisers, and you will be invited to join Enrique in the kitchen where you can roll up your sleeves and take part in the preparation of today's menu that will be a tasting menu of different traditional Chilean dishes and accompanied by some excellent Chilean wines.</p>
 <p>
Following lunch, you will then explore Chile's capital city, a sophisticated, sprawling metropolis wedged between the Andes and Coastal Ranges. Highlights will include the Palacio de La Moneda Presidential Palace, the Plaza de Armas, the city's most famous square surrounded by some beautiful buildings including the impressive Cathedral and Central Post Office. Continue to San Cristobal Hill for a panoramic view of the city and the omnipresent Andes, before heading uptown to continue to the Pueblo de Los Dominicos Handicrafts Market. This charming shopping area resembles a colonial village, and the quality products on offer range from hand knit sweaters to lapis lazuli to art and even pet animals.</p>
<p>
The evening will be at leisure.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Ritz-Carlton Santiago<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> L</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>ACONCAGUA VALLEY</h5>
<p>Today's exploration is the Aconcagua Valley. The stunning peak of Mount Aconcagua - at 22,800 feet, it is the highest peak in the Americas - actually lies across the border in Argentina, but is visible from the valley that shares its name. The valley is one of Chile's emerging wine-producing areas.</p>
<p>
Your first visit today will be to the famous Errazuriz Winery, in the picturesque village of Panquehue. This was once the largest wine producer in the world, which now vies for the title of Chile's most beautiful winery. Viña Errazuriz has been producing grapes of the highest quality since 1870 by Don Maximiano Errazuriz who recognised that cool, rainy winters, hot, dry summers and moist Pacific Ocean breezes provided ideal conditions for growing grapes.</p>
<p>
The Errázuriz philosophy is best expressed by Don Maximiano who said, "From the best land, the best wine". The tour begins among the garden's fountains and fragrant sweet peas, and climbs through the vineyards for an expansive view of the property. The finale: a wine tasting of Errázuriz's selection of Sangioveses, Pinots, and Shirazes, complemented by locally made bread and cheese. Afterward, linger on the patio over a delicious country lunch.</p>
 <p>
A mere 200 metres separates Errazuriz from Von Siebenthal, a boutique winery that produces only four wines. For over two decades, Mauro von Siebenthal, a Swiss lawyer and wine aficionado, had a dream. In 1998, with the financial support of four friends, Viña von Siebenthal finally became a reality. Viña von Siebenthal's harmonious philosophy helps create extremely elegant wines that eloquently express the extraordinary characteristics of the Valle de Aconcagua terroir. So good are Von Siebenthal's wines that one won a silver medal and three were awarded golds at the Brussels Wine Expo in 2004. Their premium Montelig won best red wine in the world at the Expo. Von Siebenthal is a no-fuss winery. There is no fancy visitor's centre or souvenir shop, just superb service and great wines.</p>
<p>
Continue through the colonial towns of San Felipe and Santa María towards the landmark Termas de Jahuel Hotel & Spa. Last December, this mountain-clinging resort, originally built in 1912, reopened after a three-year overhaul; a trio of new buildings blend seamlessly with the original wooden lodge. On-site trails weave through the surrounding pines and eucalyptus; the indoor and outdoor thermal pools and spa give you a few more excuses to unwind here.</p>
<p>
This evening you are free to enjoy the thermal pools, swimming pool and other facilities at Termas de Jahuel Hotel & Spa, with dinner being served in the restaurant.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Termas de Jahuel Hotel & Spa<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>SAN ANTONIO VALLEY</h5>
<p>This morning will be at leisure, allowing you to enjoy the facilities at Termas de Jahuel, before heading off along Route 60, which winds down the valley along the Aconcagua River, along a scenic, weaving route through peach orchards, corn and tobacco fields, and rustic pueblitos until Casablanca Valley.</p>
<p>
Casablanca is a sub-region of the Aconcagua Valley, but its vineyards - first planted in the early 1980s - have earned worldwide recognition in a relatively short space of time. The warm, temperate climate of the area is greatly influenced by the coastal sea breezes, which in combination with a perfect terroir in a valley situated on the coastal plane, with distant hills and slopes rising no more than 400 metres above sea level provide ideal conditions for certain varieties of grape. It is not unlike Santa Barbara and portions of Sonoma, and fittingly, the grapes that have done best over the past half-decade or so have been Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc.</p>
<p>
Visit Casas del Bosque winery. Upon arrival, lunch will be served on the terrace at the Tanino Wine Bar & Lunch, with its sophisticated spin on Chilean standards. Afterwards you will be invited to visit the winery and cellars. Continue with a tasting focusing on their superb, award-winning red and white wines. A selection of dried fruits and cheeses will be served to accompany the wines during the tasting.</p>
<p>
A little further east along the main Route 68, Viña Mar is another of Casablanca's emerging vineyards. Along with its whites and reds, the winery is currently producing Chile's best sparkling wines, many of which are produced and bottled for other, larger vineyards. A tasting of their superb Méthode Champenoise sparkling wine is included during the visit.</p>
<p>
Later this afternoon you will arrive to the nearby Viña Matetic, a small winery making big waves in organic winemaking and 21st-century enotourism. Drop your bags at the three-room guesthouse, a century-old estancia set among wild gardens and furnished with regal four-poster beds and wingback chairs, thick damask curtains, and lots of florals and stripes. Explore the valley on foot, horseback, or bicycle, or visit the family cheese operation, and cap the afternoon off with a tour of the winery. Dinner this evening will be served at the guest house.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Fundo El Rosario, Matetic Winery<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>SAN ANTONIO VALLEY - MAIPO VALLEY - COLCHAGUA VALLEY</h5>
<p>This morning drive to Las Vertientes in the heart of the Maipo Canyon. Located in the foothills of the Andes, with views of the River Maipo, this area is a popular weekend spot for santiaguinos. Just under an hour from the city centre, the Maipo Canyon is awash with almond and cherry plantations, sleepy mountain villages, and roadside stands selling fresh-baked bread and empanadas.</p>
<p>
Along the way you will call at the Almaviva Vineyard. Created in 1997, this is Chile's first winery conceived and managed like a French chateau, and this tour will provide an insight into the elaboration of an ultra-premium wine which combines the best of French and Chilean winemaking traditions. The visit begins with a brief history of Almaviva, a winery born from the joint venture between Concha y Toro Winery and Baron Philippe de Rothschild. The final stop is a visit to the bottling room. The tour ends with a tasting of Almaviva wine and a visit to the new Almaviva Boutique. Following the visit, lunch will then be served at the 'Fundación Origen' restaurant.</p>
<p>
Continue to the Haras de Pirque Vineyard for a visit to this unique winery. In 1991, after a highly successful business career in Chile's private sector, entrepreneur Eduardo Matte acquired this estate near Pirque, a prestigious winegrowing area situated in the Maipo Valley. The property - today covering 600 hectares - gently ascends the lower slopes of a spur of the Andes Mountains. The farm's success is reflected by a long succession of trophies won in the nation's main horseracing events and an unrivalled leadership in all of the sport's local categories: broodmare sires, stallions and general standings. In addition, the Haras is a prominent supplier for breeders and owners in South and North America, and maintains approximately 30 racehorses in the national competition circuit. The visit will include a tasting of premium wines.</p>
<p>
Continue to Santa Rita Winery's Casa Real Hotel, unquestionably one of the nicest places to spend the night near Santiago. Originally built in 1885, this wonderful property is surrounded by lush gardens. A stunning neo-Gothic chapel on the property offers a quiet place for reflection, as does the pretty patio with its bubbling fountain.

<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>ACONCAGUA VALLEY</h5>
<p>This morning you will be met in lobby of your hotel by your guide and escorted to your waiting vehicle for today's exploration of the Aconcagua Valley.</p>
<p>
The stunning peak of Mount Aconcagua - at 22,800 feet, it is the highest peak in the Americas - actually lies across the border in Argentina, but is visible from the valley that shares its name. The valley is one of Chile's emerging wine-producing areas. Your first visit today will be to the Viña Von Siebenthal, a boutique winery in the picturesque village of Panquehue that produces only four wines. Von Siebenthal is a no-fuss winery. There is no fancy visitor's centre or souvenir shop, just superb service and great wines.</p>
<p>
A mere 200 metres separates Von Siebenthal from the famous Viña Errázuriz Winery. This was once the largest wine producer in the world, which now vies for the title of Chile's most beautiful winery. The tour begins among the gardens and climbs through the vineyards for an expansive view of the property. The finale: a wine tasting of Errázuriz's selection of Sangioveses, Pinots, and Shirazes. Afterwards, a delicious picnic lunch on the grounds of the winery.</p>
<p>
May is harvest time in the Aconcagua Valley, so we will arrange for the group to participate at one of the vineyards. You will receive gloves and cutters and spend a few minutes working in the field. As an additional option. we can send a bottle of 'your wine' to you when that vintage goes on sale some 18-24 months later.</p>
<p>
This evening's dinner will be served at the Akarana Restaurant, a two-minute walk from the hotel. This restaurant offers a fusion of Asian and New Zealand specialties (owner and host Dell Taylor is herself a Kiwi) with Chilean ingredients to create a wonderful feast for the palate. The dishes are creative and fun, and the ambience reflects that very style.</p>

Enjoy a picnic lunch amongst the hippos and birds before visiting a Maasai village this afternoon.<br /><br />The floor of the crater is only 100 square miles but is home to around 30,000 animals with a high concentration of predators and some of the finest black-maned lions in Africa. Rhinos can be seen with calves at heel. Eland and waterbuck appear not to notice the human visitors, enabling photographers to shoot at ease. On the lake in the middle of the crater you may see thousands of flamingos, fluttering and shimmering like a pink heat haze. Zebra and wildebeest account for almost half the animals - gazelle, buffalo, eland, hartebeest and wart hog can also be seen.<br /></p>";

After a picnic lunch continue the drive to your lodge, centrally located in the Serengeti National Park. Enjoy game viewing en route.<br /><br />Serengeti Serena Lodge is located high on a hill offering magnificent views of the Serengeti Plains. The lodge is pure Africa. Rustic and natural, circular like an African village, its 66 rooms make up a series of rondavels. The simple style is enhanced with sophisticated detail in the form of traditional handicraft, such as wood carvings, beadwork and pottery designs. The lodge offers its own unique game trails devised in conjunction with park consultants to allow enjoyment of the Serengeti's unequalled variety of game.<br /></p>";

Whether this is your first time on safari or a return trip, the Serengeti will not disappoint.<br /><br />The Serengeti National Park is arguably the most famous national park in the world. The Serengeti perhaps defines the safari experience as surely as the wildlife that inhabits it. Established in 1951, and covering an area of almost 15,000 square kilometers, an area comparable to the state of Connecticut or Northern Ireland, the Serengeti hosts a fantastically diverse ecosystem. The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, when 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other game that follow close behind make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";
