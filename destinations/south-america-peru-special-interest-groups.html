<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong>  13 days</p>
<p>This comprehensive programme takes visitors to the major highlights of this fascinating country.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong> Lima, Colca Canyon, Arequipa, Puno, Juliaca, Cusco, Urubamba, Machu Picchu.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>ARRIVAL LIMA</h5>
<p>Evening arrival at Lima International Airport, you will be met and transferred to your hotel.</p>
<p>
The city of Lima was founded by the Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro on January 5, 1535, the eve of the Epiphany of the Magi - from which it derived its evocative original name of La Ciudad de los Reyes or "The City of Kings".  It is a city of rare fascination and unexpected pleasures. Lima has decaying colonial splendour and the teeming vitality of an oriental bazaar; melancholy cloudy winters and warm breezy summers; impoverished urban sprawl and quiet elegant corners among ancient buildings where the night air is scented with jasmine.</p>
<p>Your stay in Lima will be at the Miraflores Park Hotel, an Orient Express property.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Miraflores Park Hotel</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>LIMA - AREQUIPA - COLCA CANYON</h5>
<p>In the morning, you will be transferred to the airport for your flight to Arequipa. On arrival in Arequipa you will be met and transferred by private vehicle on a scenic drive to Colca, approximately four hours outside Arequipa. A winding road leaves the city finally arriving at one of the most beautiful places on earth: the Colca Canyon. Local geologists claim that Colca, with chasms that can measure up to 3,400 metres (11,000 feet) top to bottom, is the world's deepest canyon.  </p>
<p>The valley has beautiful pre-Columbian terraces that are still farmed by native collaguas.</p>
<p>
Rest of the afternoon at your leisure, you can choose between the different activities at the hotel.</p>

<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>COLCA CANYON - AREQUIPA</h5>
<p>Early this morning depart for the Condor Cross, a location at which you will have an opportunity to observe these magnificent birds gliding over the canyon and around mountain peaks.</p>
<p>
Midmorning, transfer back to Arequipa. Box Lunch included.</p>
<p>
Afternoon visit Arequipa's Main Square, Cathedral and the Santa Catalina's Monastery, the most important and impressive religious monument of Peru. Arequipa's narrow streets, gardens and squares have Spanish names and are reminiscent of the old neighbourhoods of Granada and Sevilla.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Libertador Arequipa Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>AREQUIPA - JULIACA - PUNO</h5>
<p>This morning you will be transferred to the airport for your flight to Juliaca. Upon arrival in Juliaca, you will be met and transferred to your hotel in Puno.</p>
<p>
On the way, visit the mysterious pre-Inca cemetery of Sillustani.  Sillustani's circular burial towers, or chullpas, overlook Lake Umayo. It is believed that the chullpas were used as burial chambers for the nobles of the Colla civilisation.</p>
<p>
Rest of the afternoon will be at your leisure. Dinner will be at local restaurant.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Libertador Puno Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>PUNO</h5>
<p>Today you have a full day excursion on Lake Titicaca. At 3820 metres above sea level, is the highest navigable lake in the world. At over 170 kilometres long, it is also the largest lake in South America. Its altitude means the air is unusually clear and the azure waters particularly striking.</p>
<p>
Sightseeing on the islands of Uros and Taquile are followed by lunch at a local restaurant in Taquile. The floating islands of the Uros, a small tribe (now intermarried, however, so pure-blooded Uros no longer exist), is an interesting excursion. The islands themselves are constructed from the tortura reed found in abundance in Lake Titicaca. The Uros' homes and boats are also made of tortura, and their entire lives revolve around their famed reed-weaving.</p>
<p>
On the island of Taquile inhabitants dress in homemade traditional colourful clothing - men in elegant waistcoats and floppy knit caps; women in layered skirts and embroidered blouses. Quechua is their language and they maintain a very individual and independent lifestyle. This beautiful island setting holds several terraced hillsides of Inca ruins which you are free to explore.</p>
<p>Dinner at hotel.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Libertador Puno Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>

<li>
<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>PUNO - JULIACA - CUSCO - URUBAMBA</h5>
<p>This morning you are transferred to the airport for your flight to Cusco, an Andean community and former ancient capital of the Inca Empire. Upon arrival in Cusco, you are met and transferred to the Sacred Valley of the Incas, Urubamba.</p>
<p>
On your way to your hotel visit  the local village of Pisac, known for its market. This bustling market attracts tourists from all over the world who try bartering for local sweaters, ponchos, wall hangings, jewelry and goods.  </p>
<p>
Arrive at your hotel for check in and lunch.</p>
<p>
Afternoon visit the massive fortress of Ollantaytambo. A formidable stone structure that climbs massive terraces to the top of a peak, this was the valley's main defence against the Antis and was the site of the Incas' greatest victory against the Spanish during the wars of conquest. Constructed of rose-coloured granite, this huge installation was once a thriving complex of baths, temples and military barracks.  </p>
<p>
Return to your hotel for dinner.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Sol y Luna Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 8</h4>
<h5>URUBAMBA</h5>
<p>Today you will enjoy a tour with your guide to the market of Chincheros. A town of Inca origin, its church was one of the most important Colonial era churches with Baroque altars and walls with richly painted scenes. Its Sunday fair draws country folk once a week from all corners of the valley to exchange their products.</p>
<p>During your tour of Chincheros you will have the opportunity to visit a traditional Andean Textile Centre. Here, you will learn how wool is shorn from the llamas and alpacas, and later spun, dyed and woven to produce a range of beautiful products that you will be able to buy if you wish.</p>
<p>
Enjoy a delicious lunch in the charming Hacienda Huayocari, where the Lambarri-Orihuelas, a family of great collectors, will be your hosts. You will be able to appreciate a valuable collection of Colonial and folk art. </p> 
<p>
Afternoon visit to Kuychi Centre, this charity was created in 2003 to support Heléna van Engelen's "Niños del Arco Iris" (Children of the Rainbow)  project in Peru. The project focuses on offering a future to extremely deprived children who are exposed to many risks as a result of great poverty. Add to this the lack of hygiene, medical care, food, schooling and, above all, love and you have the causes of the terrible predicament of many Peruvian children and young people</p>
<p>
Early evening before dinner experience a local ritual, or Pago a la tierra, an ancient ritual that pays homage to Pachamama, the earth mother. Ritual offerings of chicha, (beer), coca leaves, flowers and fruits are placed in the earth accompanied by evocative chanting and singing.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Sol y Luna Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 9</h4>
<h5>URUBAMBA - MACHU PICCHU</h5>
<p>This morning board the new deluxe Orient Express train Hiram Bingham to Machu Picchu, where a late morning arrival gives you time to begin your explorations of this breathtaking Incan citadel. Light lunch will be served on board. Upon arrival in Aguas Calientes train station, a 25 minute bus ride will bring you to the ruins of Machu Picchu.</p>
<p>
Accompanied by your guide, explore the city's ruins, and feel its pulse as you visualise the lives of the priests, craftsmen and servants who inhabited this seemingly uninhabitable citadel.  Excavations at the site have revealed skeletons, artifacts and woolen clothing, but no gold. The same precision of assembled stones exists here as in other Incan sites. Overlooking the raging Urubamba River and discovered in a hidden tangle of vines and trees atop the mountain, the city of Machu Picchu will forever hold its secret of its destruction - the Incas left no written record.</p>
<p>
While in Machu Picchu you will be accommodated at the Machu Picchu Santuary Lodge which enjoys a unique position at the entrance of the Inca Citadel ruins, at 8,200 feet above sea level. Late afternoon enjoy teatime. Dinner will also be at hotel.

<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong>  10 days </p>
<p>Land of the Incas, Peru is home to many archaeological delights. This special interest programme explores many of the major Peruvian archaeological sites.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong> Lima, Chiclayo, Trujillo, Cusco, Machu Picchu.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>ARRIVE LIMA</h5>
<p>Evening arrival at Lima International Airport, you will be met and transferred to your hotel.</p>
<p>
The city of Lima was founded by the Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro on January 5, 1535, the eve of the Epiphany of the Magi - from which it derived its evocative original name of La Ciudad de los Reyes or "The City of Kings". It is a city of rare fascination and unexpected pleasures. Lima has decaying colonial splendour and the teeming vitality of an oriental bazaar; melancholy cloudy winters and warm breezy summers; impoverished urban sprawl and quiet elegant corners among ancient buildings where the night air is scented with jasmine.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Miraflores Park Hotel</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>LIMA</h5>
<p>
<p>Morning at leisure.</p>
<p>
This afternoon you are taken on a tour of the "City of the Kings". Visit the historical centre of Lima. See the Plaza Mayor, the location of the Government Palace, the City Hall, the Cathedral and the Archbishop's Palace. The rich, religious history of the Spanish colonies is displayed in these buildings. You will also have time to visit the San Francisco Monastery. Following your tour of Historic Lima you will continue to the Larco Herrera museum where Ulla Holmquist, the museum's Chief Curator, will be waiting to guide you around the exhibition.
<p>
The visit to the Larco Museum allows you to have a clear and entertained approach to the evolution of the cultures of ancient Peru. Walking through the exhibition halls of the Larco Museum - the largest private collection of pre-Columbian art in the world - with Ms Holmquist makes the visit an inspiring experience that gives first-hand information about the collection and the people that made the beautiful archaeological objects.</p>
<p>
Upon finishing your museum tour you will be transferred to the Huaca Pucllana restaurant for dinner. This restaurant is located in one of the biggest pre-Columbian temples of the city offering a unique ambiance. It specialises in contemporary Peruvian cuisine using a wide range of Peruvian ingredients.</p>

<strong>Overnight:</strong> Miraflores Park Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,D</p>
</li>

<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>LIMA - CHICLAYO</h5>
<p>
This morning you will be transferred to Lima International Airport for your flight to Chiclayo. On arrival at Chiclayo Airport, you will be met and transferred to your hotel for immediate check-in.</p>
<p>
This morning you will visit Tucume. This site, 33 kilometres north of Chiclayo, was an important settlement for the Lambayeque culture, and comprises some 20 adobe pyramids, almost 40 metres high, as well as some other lesser buildings. They are all constructed around Mount Purgatorio, and were used by Chimu and Incas until they were abandoned after the Spanish conquest.</p>
<p>
This afternoon, tour the Royal Tombs of Sipan Museum which exhibits the most important archaeological remains of the Mochica culture. The exceptional exhibition shows the jewels, emblems and ornaments found in 1987 in the tomb of a Mochica government leader called the Lord of Sipan. The museum has its origin in a project of organised archaeological rescue in April of 1987, when a small team of Peruvian archaeologists assumed the responsibility of saving and investigating the archaeological sanctuary of Sipan, as opposed to its violent sacking and destruction. </p>
<p>
After lunch at local restaurant, continue by private vehicle to Sipan, the famous complex uncovered in 1987 by the Peruvian archaeologist Walter Alva and his team. Sipan is the richest pre-Hispanic burial yet discovered in the Americas and belonged to a young Mochica dignitary of the fourth century known as the Lord of Sipan. After the first discovery two more tombs were found, one of a priest and another of an older dignitary, designated the Old Lord of Sipan.</p>

<strong>Overnight:</strong> Gran Hotel Chiclayo<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> L</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>CHICLAYO - TRUJILLO</h5>
<p>
This morning depart by private bus to the city of Trujillo, located in the fertile Moche River Valley. Inhabited since ancient times by fishermen and farmers, between the first and seventh centuries AD, these territories were the dominion of one of the most famous ancient cultures of Peru, the Mochica, whose many impressive remains can still be seen around Trujillo.</p>
<p>
On the way, visit El Brujo. This archaeological site 61 km from Trujillo contains three large buildings constructed in different eras. They are the Huaca Prieta, (thought to be the oldest construction on the Peruvian coast), Huaca el Brujo, (constructed by the Mochica culture), and Huaca Cao Viejo, where Lady of Cao, a female mummy was discovered last year with complex tattoos on her arms. Archaeologists say this one of the best relics ever found of a civilisation that ended more than 1,300 years ago</p>
<p>
Arrival in Trujillo with time free for a lunch.</p>
<p>
This afternoon the tour begins with a visit to the Main Square, considered the biggest in Peru. It was designed in the midst of the conquest by Martín de Estete and is surrounded by the Cathedral, palaces and large old colonial and republican houses. In the middle of the Square, decorated with exuberant palm trees, is the monument dedicated to La Libertad. This is where Peru's independence was first proclaimed in 1820. Also visit the Archaeological Museum at the University, which has wonderful displays of newly discovered items from the Huaca de la Luna, as well as positively ancient pre-Columbian finds, which date from as long ago as 12000 BC.</p>
<p>
Dinner will be served at the exclusive Club Central, a bright yellow mansion which is an excellent example of neoclassical civil architecture and dates to the 19th century. It is now Trujillo's traditional social club.</p>

<strong>Overnight:</strong> Libertador Trujillo Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>TRUJILLO - LIMA</h5>
<p>
Your full day tour will start with a visit to the Sun and Moon Pyramids, an archaeological site consisting of enormous adobe constructions over 20m (65ft) high built by the Mochica culture. The Sun Pyramid is considered the largest adobe pyramid in Peru. The Moon Pyramid has extensive burial grounds and some fine murals in which a deity is often repeated.</p>
<p>
Continue to Huanchaco beach, famous for its caballitos de Totora, the small reed crafts used for fishing. Lunch will be at a local restaurant.</p>
<p>
Afternoon tour Chan Chan, the capital of the Chimu culture, built between the 12th and 14th centuries by the rulers of the Tacaynamo dynasty. Considered the largest adobe city in pre-Hispanic America, it covers an area of more than 20 sq km and housed some 100,000 people. The city has a maze of streets, canals, water reservoirs, silos, plazas, terraces and truncated pyramids.</p>
<p>
Later transfer to the airport for your flight to Lima. Upon arrival you will be met and transferred to your hotel.</p>

<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>LIMA - CUSCO</h5>
<p>
This morning you are transferred to the airport where you embark on your flight to Cusco, an Andean community and former ancient capital of the Inca Empire.</p>
<p>
Upon arrival in Cusco, you are met and transferred to your hotel.  The rest of the morning is left free to relax and acclimatise, as you are now at 3400 metres altitude. We recommend minimal activity and the local remedy of coca tea, (which is in plentiful supply), for those who are susceptible.</p>
<p>
After a light lunch at your hotel, enjoy a city tour which includes the Cathedral on the Plaza de Armas and the Santo Domingo Temple or Koricancha; a Dominican Church and convent built on the foundations of the Koricancha or "place of gold",  the Incas principal religious building dedicated to the worship of the sun.</p>
<p>
Just outside of Cusco, your visit this afternoon takes you to the ruins of Sacsayhuaman, a testimonial to Incan architectural skills.  Compiled of massive stones (one weighs 125 tons) you are challenged to try to slip a piece of paper between the cracks of these blocks, cut and fitted together with incredible precision without a single drop of mortar to hold them in place. This ancient fortress where the greatest battle between the Spanish and Incas took place, overlooks the red-tiled roofs of Cusco and the spectacular lush countryside.  Also visit Qenqo ("The Labyrinth"), an Incan shrine dedicated to the Earth Mother.</p>
   <p>
Your tour will end with a cocktail at the Quinta Colcampata, a beautiful historic house overlooking the city of Cusco.</p>

<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>CUSCO - MACHU PICCHU</h5>
<p>
This morning board the new deluxe Orient Express train Hiram Bingham to Machu Picchu, where a late morning arrival gives you time to begin your explorations of this breathtaking Incan citadel. Light lunch will be served on board.</p>
<p>
Accompanied by your guide, explore the city's ruins and feel its pulse as you visualise the lives of the priests, craftsmen and servants who inhabited this seemingly uninhabitable citadel.  Excavations at the site have revealed skeletons, artefacts and woollen clothing, but no gold. The same precision of assembled stones exists here as in other Incan sites. Overlooking the raging Urubamba River and discovered in a hidden tangle of vines and trees atop the mountain, the city of Machu Picchu will forever hold its secret of its destruction - the Incas left no written record.</p>
<p>
Afternoon tea and dinner will be served at hotel. While in Machu Picchu you will be accommodated at the Machu Picchu Sanctuary Lodge which enjoys a unique position at the entrance of the Inca Citadel ruins, at 8,200 feet above sea level.</p>

<p>
Today your special host in Machu Picchu will be Alfredo Mormontoy Atayupanqui. Formerly resident archaeologist at Machu Picchu, researcher and consultant in conservation and restoration projects, he has participated in more than twenty different excavations and archaeology research projects to date.

<h4>Day 9</h4>
<h5>CUSCO - URUBAMBA - CUSCO</h5>
<p>This morning depart for the Urubamba Valley to the local village of Pisac, known for its colourful market. This bustling market attracts tourists from all over the world who try bartering for local sweaters, ponchos, wall hangings, jewellery and goods. </p>
<p>
You will have time to shop before enjoying lunch at the Huayoccari Hacienda where the Lambarri-Orihuelas, a family of great collectors, will be your hosts. You will be able to see a valuable collection of Colonial and folk art. Located on the summit of a hill sheltered amidst Andean peaks, you will find here one of the finest views of the Sacred Valley of the Incas.</p>
<p>
After lunch, continue on to the massive fortress of Ollantaytambo.  A formidable stone structure that climbs massive terraces to the top of a peak, this was the valley's main defence against the Antis and was the site of the Incas' greatest victory against the Spanish during the wars of conquest. Constructed of rose-coloured granite, this huge installation was once a thriving complex of baths, temples and military barracks. Below the fortress lies a complete Incan town, also called Ollantaytambo, still inhabited and with its original architecture and layout preserved.   </p>
<p>
Your farewell dinner today will be at the restaurant of the Pre-Columbian Art Museum. This house was an Inca ceremonial court around 1450 and in 1580 became into the mansion of the conqueror Alonso Díaz. This extraordinary Cusco historic monument holds the only museum in Peru dedicated to the arts of ancient Peruvian cultures. After dinner you will have the opportunity to visit the museum.</p>

Enjoy a picnic lunch amongst the hippos and birds before visiting a Maasai village this afternoon.<br /><br />The floor of the crater is only 100 square miles but is home to around 30,000 animals with a high concentration of predators and some of the finest black-maned lions in Africa. Rhinos can be seen with calves at heel. Eland and waterbuck appear not to notice the human visitors, enabling photographers to shoot at ease. On the lake in the middle of the crater you may see thousands of flamingos, fluttering and shimmering like a pink heat haze. Zebra and wildebeest account for almost half the animals - gazelle, buffalo, eland, hartebeest and wart hog can also be seen.<br /></p>";

Rustic and natural, circular like an African village, its 66 rooms make up a series of rondavels. The simple style is enhanced with sophisticated detail in the form of traditional handicraft, such as wood carvings, beadwork and pottery designs.

The Serengeti perhaps defines the safari experience as surely as the wildlife that inhabits it. Established in 1951, and covering an area of almost 15,000 square kilometers, an area comparable to the state of Connecticut or Northern Ireland, the Serengeti hosts a fantastically diverse ecosystem. The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, when 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other game that follow close behind make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";
