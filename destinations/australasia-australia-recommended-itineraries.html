<h5>Arrive Sydney, Australia</h5>
<p>Upon arrival, your hotel room is ready for you. Take time to settle in and rest before exploring Sydney - a former penal colony dating back to the 18th century and now a vibrant, multicultural city - at leisure. Your explorations might take you to wander around the historic Rocks area, the original settlement of the city. Later this afternoon, take a private tea-time cruise of Sydney Harbour, and look out onto the lush surrounding parklands, reserves and gardens.</p>

<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Sydney</h5>
<p>This morning, depart by ferry for a privately guided visit to Taronga Zoo, home to an aquarium, rainforest aviary, nocturnal animal abode and a koala house. The zoo is located next to the water, and you enjoy magnificent harbor views as you zigzag the paths leading to animal enclosures. You also come face to face with local "residents," including emus, kangaroos, wombats, koalas and kookaburras. Afterward, head to famous Bondi Beach and learn to ride the waves during a surfing lesson with an Aussie surfer (minimum age is seven). Later tonight, attend a welcome dinner, and meet other families sharing your adventure.</p>

In this vast land of deserts and semi-arid plains, you and your family witness a mixture of light and color seen nowhere else on earth. The sky here is a bright blue, and the clear air causes the sun to sparkle as it reflects on the red rocks below. Embark on a thrilling ATV ride on a private cattle ranch, where you and your young explorers traverse bush tracks, dry riverbeds and the base of mountain ranges. Tonight, attend a traditional Aussie-style barbecue amid the bush and beneath the endless stars for an unforgettable, quintessential experience.</p>

Continue on to The Royal Flying Doctor Service - a service providing medical care to those residing in Australia's furthest reaches - and the Alice Springs Telegraph Station. Later this afternoon, board a flight to Uluru (Ayers Rock), and visit this sacred Aboriginal site. Walk along its base, viewing hallowed locales and paintings of ancient Aboriginal tribal myths.

A wide range of activities are offered at Olonana and you can plan your day to be as active or as leisurely as you wish. Visit the adjacent Maasai village, take a morning bush walk with an armed ranger or enjoy sundowners in the evening or even dinner under the stars in the middle of the African bush.<br /><br />In the Mara, the wildlife is abundant and the swaying grasslands ensure that animals are never out of sight. Elephants browse amongst the large herds of wildebeest, topi, gazelle, eland and buffalo. The plains offer a rich variety of food for the dominant predators: lion, leopard, hyena and cheetah. In the Mara River, hippos submerge while crocodiles sunbathe on the riverbanks.<br /><br />Around July to September, rain depending, the Masai Mara is host to the famous wildebeest migration which is one of the few remaining mass migrations of mammals in the world. During this time herds of over a million wildebeest will trawl their way through this region and they become the major focus for predatory activity and drama unfolds at every corner.<br /><br />There are also options for a morning balloon safari or a half-day visit to Lake Victoria.<br /><br />Balloon Safari: As the balloon is inflated against the first rays of sunrise your pilot will go through safety procedures. Once aloft, the balloon floats gently over the plains, giving a bird's eye view of the game below as the sun creeps slowly over the horizon. After around one hour the balloon lands as breakfast is already being prepared and, of course, enjoy a glass or two of bubbly to toast your flight in a tradition initiated by the Montgolfier brothers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lake Victoria Adventure : An early start this morning with a transfer to the airstrip for a flight by light aircraft to Lake Victoria. On arrival enjoy an appetising full English breakfast before you board the boat for the morning. There will be the opportunity to try fishing for the legendary giant Nile perch found in these waters as you explore the myriad of tiny islands in this region of the lake. An experienced and knowledgeable fisherman captains each boat. There is the chance to stop at a traditional fishing village and see how the villagers live from day to day before returning to the airstrip for your return flight to the Masai Mara.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p>";

Enjoy a full day exploring the Serengeti by 4WD vehicle with thrilling morning and afternoon game drives. Whether this is your first time on safari or a return trip the Serengeti will not disappoint.<br /><br />The Serengeti National Park is arguably the most famous national park in the world. The Serengeti perhaps defines the safari experience as surely as the wildlife that inhabits it. Established in 1951, and covering an area of almost 15,000 sq km, an area comparable to the state of Connecticut or Northern Ireland, the Serengeti hosts a fantastically diverse ecosystem. The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, where 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other plains game that follow close behind, make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";

The Selous supports around one million game animals, is bigger than Switzerland and is a World Heritage site.

Transfer from Arusha to Ngorongoro Crater Lodge located on the rim with spectacular views across the crater. The Ngorongoro Crater is the largest unbroken caldera in the world and the first sight of it is breathtaking.<br /><br />Ngorongoro Crater Lodge is situated on the edge of the ancient crater rim above the cool, swirling mists. The lodge is a return to the noble elegance of the travelling colonials. Inspired in design by the Maasai Manyatta, three separate camps of 6 to 12 suites each remember a bygone era when characters such as Lord Delamere adorned the stilted, handcrafted structures with graceful antiques, grand chandeliers and treasures collected from travels through Africa.<br /><br /></p>";

Enjoy a picnic lunch amongst the hippos and birds before visiting a Maasai village this afternoon.<br /><br />The floor of the crater is only 100 sq miles but is home to around 30,000 animals with a high concentration of predators and some of the finest black-maned lions in Africa. Rhinos can often be seen with calves at heel. Eland and waterbuck appear not to notice the human visitors, enabling photographers to shoot at ease. On the lake in the middle of the crater you may see thousands of flamingos fluttering and shimmering like a pink heat haze. Zebra and wildebeest account for almost half the animals.
