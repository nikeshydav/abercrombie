<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong>  6 days </p>
<p>A fascinating introduction to Cambodia - a land of ancient cultures and modern day atrocities.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong> Siem Reap, Angkor Wat, Phnom Penh.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>ARRIVE SIEM REAP</h5>
<p>Your travel experience starts the minute you disembark when our representative will be there to breeze you through immigration and customs through a special channel. After clearing immigration and customs, our guide will accompany you to the legendary Raffles Grand Hotel d'Angkor.</p>
<p>
After a traditional Khmer lunch, get an insight into Angkor through Darryl Collins, a leading expert in Khmer history. His passion for Asian arts brought him to Cambodia in 1994 with a team of experts from the National Gallery of Australia to work with an Australian government-funded project assisting the National Museum of Cambodia in Phnom Penh. Drawing on the knowledge that he gained in Cambodia and his passion for Asian arts, he lectures at the Department of Archaeology at the Royal University of Fine Arts in Phnom Penh.  Besides lecturing he spends the rest of his time writing  about art, architecture and culture.</p>
<p>
Late afternoon, visit Angkor Wat, the largest of the Khmer monuments. Built around the first half of the 12th century by King Suryavarman II, the temple's balance, composition and beauty make it one of the finest monuments in the world.</p>
<p>
This evening before dinner join the children from a local orphanage for a traditional folk dance.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight: </strong> Raffles Grand Hotel d' Angkor<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> L </p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>SIEM REAP</h5>
<p>Early morning witness the beautiful sunrise at Angkor Wat which is regarded by many as the quintessential Angkor experience.</p>
<p>
After breakfast, continue to another great sight. Known to many as the pink temple, Banteay Srei is a 10th century temple dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva. Banteay Srei is built largely of red sandstone, a medium that lends itself to the elaborate decorative wall carvings which are still observable today.</p>
<p>
On the way to Banteay Seri, visit one of the local villages where we have helped provide a series of water wells that supply fresh water to the local village. Free flowing fresh water is a basic humanitarian necessity that the Cambodian government is currently unable to provide to all of the villages in the countryside. Through the kind and generous donations of our guests, we have been able to provide over 30 villages with fresh water under guidance of our local guide Sam. We are very proud to be affiliated to this wonderful humanitarian project Continue your journey to the Landmine Museum and meet Aki Ra, founder of the Cambodia Landmine Museum and National Project Manager for the CLMMRF (NGO). He began his life as a child living in the countryside prior to the Khmer Rouge Revolution. His mother and father were killed during the Pol Pot regime and he soon found himself living in a Khmer Rouge camp for children.</p>
<p>
Return to the hotel at midday for some time to relax. After lunch, visit Angkor Thom, the last and most enduring capital city of the Khmer empire. Standing tall within Angkor Thom is the Bayon temple which was the last state temple to be built at Angkor and it's here that the Terrace of the Leper King and the Terrace of Elephants can be seen.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Raffles Grand Hotel d' Angkor<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>SIEM REAP</h5>
<p>After breakfast, begin by visiting Little Circuit, the route comprising Victory Gate, Thommanon, Chau Say Tevoda, Spean Thma, Takeo, Ta Prohm, Banteay Kdei and Prasat Kravan. </p>
<p>Move on to the Grand Circuit, a royal city forming a rectangle of 700 by 800 metres, surrounded by a moat similar to Ta Prohm but only with four enclosures.</p>
<p>
After lunch at local restaurant, you will embark on a boat to visit the floating village of Tonle Sap. The residents of the floating village reside on houses which stay afloat on the river and the lake. An unusual characteristic of this river is that its water flow changes, depending on the season. As the rainy season sets in and as the water level rises, the residents move their houses by boat closer to shore. During the dry season, they again move their houses towards the lake.</p>
<p>
The river links the Mekong River to the southern end of the Great Lake. The lake was the lifeline of the Khmers as it served as a source of fish and rice to the agrarian society.</p>
<p>
After that transfer to Artisans D'Angkor which was created to help young people find work in their home villages, allowing them to practice their crafts and providing them with a vocation and a role in society. Artisans D' Angkor has renewed Khmer cultural identity and showcases traditional Cambodiam workmanship.</p>

<h5>SIEM REAP - PHNOM PENH</h5>
<p>After breakfast your guide will accompany you to Siem Reap airport for your flight to Phnom Penh. After clearing immigration and customs upon arrival in the Cambodian capital, you will be will be transferred to Raffles Hotel Phnom Penh.</p>
<p>
In the afternoon, you will visit the The Royal Palace. The structure you will be seeing today was constructed earlier this century on the site of the Banteay Kev, a citadel built in 1813. The structure is strongly influenced by the Royal Palace and the Royal Temple in Bangkok. Visitors are only allowed to go inside the Palace's Silver Pagoda and its surrounding compound.</p>
<p>
The Silver Pagoda, also known as Wat Preah Keo, was given its name because of over 5,000 silver tiles weighing 1 kilogram each that cover the floor.</p>
<p>
Continue to the the National Museum of Khmer Art and Archaeology, otherwise known as "Musee des Beaux-Arts" or "Musee Albert Sarraut". This museum is considered to be one of the finest museums of classical Cambodian art.</p>
<p>
The Russian Market is popular among tourists, local expatriates and Cambodians alike. Located in southern Phnom Penh it is so called because of its popularity among Russian expatriates during the 1980s.</p>

<p>Your exciting journey continues once you disembark at the public pier, here you will take a short ride on a Tuk Tuk (a motorised tricycle, one of the symbols of Bangkok) to visit the Grand Palace and Emerald Buddha Temple, perhaps the greatest spectacle for any
visitor to Bangkok. It consists of over 100 brightly coloured buildings, golden spires and glittering mosaics, and dates back to 1782 when Bangkok was founded. Wat Phra Kaew (Temple of Emerald Buddha) itself, is Thailand's most important and sacred temple.</p>

Credited with re-establishing the Thai silk industry, Mr. Thompson was an enigmatic figure who had great passion for all things oriental. After settling in Thailand following the Second World War, he set about developing the silk industry as well as amassing a considerable collection of oriental antiques and artworks. Mr. Thompson mysteriously disappeared in Malaysia in 1967 and today his home has been opened to the public for visits.</p>
<p>
In the afternoon visit the Prasart Museum, a private family gallery that highlights the artistic splendour of Thai culture. The complex is made up of two exquisite teak houses built in the traditional Thai style, which display a wealth of handicrafts. There is also a mansion in the style of 19th century France which exhibits an extensive collection of objets d'art from both Europe and the Thai royal family's personal collection. After visiting the gallery, chat with Khun Prasart Vongsakul, owner of the Prasart Museum and ardently devoted to preserving Thai antiquity. The opportunity to meet Khun Prasart is dependent on your travelling dates and Khun Prasart's availability.</p>
