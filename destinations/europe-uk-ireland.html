Great Britain travellers prefer starting from the capital of United Kingdom-London which is also a global financial centre. An iconic landmark city, London has a wide array of stores, bars, restaurants and hotels to welcome its guests. The countryside of Southern England has a thorough gentle approach laden with hills, fenlands and country lanes that mingle with the historic cities of Oxford, Cambridge and Bath. The southern coast to Cornwall has picturesque landscape with little figurines of towns, beaches and resorts.</p>
<p>
Travel further into UK to the Northern England Wales to understand their historic mood. National parks and amazing coastlines are just some attractions. Lake District is the largest park which plays a game of lagged mountains interspersed with lakes and villages. Wales is called the 'land of castles' with one of the most varied scenic-view of Europe visible. </p>
<p>
Holidays in UK are not complete without a look at the mountainous country of Scotland. Bagpipes and kits in the criss-cross of mountains and Central Lowlands give rise to Edinburgh, Scotland's capital city. It is one of the most dramatically-located capital cities that house an international Arts Festival every summer. Towards the north, the Highlands and Islands form Europe's last great wildernesses. The Scottish clans pride themselves on having magnificent peaks, windswept moorlands and lonely sea inlets.</p>
<p>
Ireland is also called the 'Emerald Isle'. Vacation tours to Ireland are a hit because of the mild damp climate with high incidence of rainfalls that gives it the green cover, attracting many travellers. Stroll in the pastoral countryside and visit the castles and villages on the way. Enjoy natural beauty in Connemara or Kerry. Indulge in dairy products and ride on horse backs while being in a thriving dairy industry. As Dublin is the capital of Ireland, you must see its Georgian architecture and its happening nightlife scene. </p>
<h1>Best Time to Go UK & Ireland </h1>
<div class="Clr"></div>
<h4>Best time to go to UK &amp; Ireland  </h4>
<p>The months from April to October are the traditional time to visit the British Isles. As well as being the warmest time of the year, it is also when British Summer Time extends daylight long into the evenings. It is during this period that visitor attractions are fully operational, and when many social and sporting occasions take place.</p>
<p>
During the months from April to June, the countryside bursts into bloom. Wild daffodils and bluebells herald the start of the season when gardens are at their most colourful.</p>
<p>
July and August are the hottest months in the year, both in terms of  temperature and events! The abundance of thrilling competitions, breathtaking festivals and plenty of other colourful events, some of which are detailed below, cater for all tastes. However, if you fancy a family vacation or a relaxing retreat from everyday life in one of the stunning resorts, there's a great variety to choose from.</p>
<p>
During the winter months, days are short and the temperatures are often cold. Many attractions in the countryside close for the season. However, the city museums and sights remain open, and their restaurants and theatres will be in full swing.</p>
<p>
Visitors who travel over Christmas or New Year may enjoy these celebrations in the cities. But this is also a time when the country house hotels offer festive programs which make an excellent addition to a city break.</p>

<ul class="intrestGrouplisting">
<li>Conservative “smart casual” clothing will be most useful for daytime touring. While jeans are acceptable, “smart casual” attire in Britain often means stylish slacks or skirt outfit for women and a shirt with collar and slacks for men. Cotton and other light fabrics are comfortable choices for summertime. Spring and autumn temperatures dictate medium-weight clothing selections.</li>

<li>Everyday street wear in Ireland tends to be somewhat less formal than in other European countries. Cotton and other lighter weight fabrics are comfortable choices for summertime Ireland. Spring and autumn temperatures dictate medium-weight clothing selections.</li>

<li>When dining at country house hotels, better restaurants and especially at private homes, dress is more formal. For gentlemen, a “jacket and tie” standard is appropriate (although not always required), with an equivalent standard of eveningwear for ladies.</li>

<li>	Bring comfortable walking shoes with low or no heels. An umbrella or light raincoat may come in handy. Pack a swimming suit, as some hotels have pools.
