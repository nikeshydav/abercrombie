<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong>  8 days </p>
<p>What better way to start an exploration of the Southeast Asia than this introduction to Thailand, and two of its neighbours Laos and Cambodia.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong> Bangkok, Luang Prabang, Siem Reap.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>ARRIVE BANGKOK</h5>
<p>Your travel experience starts the minute you disembark when our representative will be right there to breeze you through immigration and customs, after which you will be accompanied to the legendary Mandarin Oriental Hotel.</p>
<p>Upon arrival, explore the many facilities the hotel has to offer or just relax in the comfort of your room. The remainder of the day is at leisure.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Mandarin Oriental </p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>BANGKOK</h5>
<p>This morning experience an important part of Thai culture by offering food to the monks at a local temple. Afterwards cruise along the legendary Chao Phraya River and canals where you will see the family homes and temples dotted along the waterways which inspired Bangkok's reference as the "Venice of the East".</p>
<p>
Your exciting journey continues once you disembark at the public pier, here you will take a short ride on a tuk tuk (a motorised tricycles, one of the symbols of Bangkok) to visit the Grand Palace and Emerald Buddha Temple. Perhaps the greatest spectacle for any visitor to Bangkok, it consists of over 100 brightly coloured buildings, golden spires and glittering mosaics, and dates back to 1782 when Bangkok was founded. Wat Phra Kaew (Temple of
Emerald Buddha) itself, is Thailand's most important and sacred temple.</p>
<p>
After enjoy local cuisine for lunch, visit the Arts of the Kingdom Exhibition at the Ananda Samakhom Throne Hall (closed on Mondays). The Arts of the Kingdom is an exhibition of exquisite but rarely seen traditional Thai crafts created by artists under The Foundation for the Promotion of Supplementary Occupations and Related Techniques under the Royal Patronage of Her Majesty Queen Sirikit of Thailand.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Mandarin Oriental<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>BANGKOK</h5>
<p>After breakfast, visit the home of the American adventurer, Jim Thompson. Credited with re-establishing the Thai silk industry, Mr. Thompson was an enigmatic figure who had great passion for all things oriental. After settling in Thailand following the Second World War, he set about developing the silk industry as well as amassing a considerable collection of oriental antiques and artworks. Mr. Thompson mysteriously disappeared in Malaysia in 1967 and today his home has been opened to the public for visits.</p>
<p>
After a sumptuous lunch at local restaurant, visit the Prasart Museum, a private family gallery that highlights the artistic splendour of Thai culture. The complex is made up of two exquisite teak houses built in the traditional Thai style which display a wealth of handicrafts. There is also a mansion in the style of 19th century France which exhibits an extensive collection of objets d'art from both Europe and the Thai royal family's personal collection. After visiting the gallery, chat with Khun Prasart Vongsakul, owner of Prasart Museum and ardently devoted to preserving Thai antiquity.
(This activity is dependent on your travelling dates and Khun Prasart's availability)</p>
<p>
After dinner, together with your guide you will explore the largest flower market in Thailand. The area around the flower market is transformed into a hypnotic kaleidoscope of activity, as fresh deliveries arrive and then leave in the hands of the wholesalers, florists and hotel buyers who come at this time to find the freshest flowers. It's a real treat for the senses, with many great photo opportunities.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Mandarin Oriental<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>BANGKOK - LUANG PRABANG</h5>
<p>This morning bid goodbye to Thailand and journey to mystical Laos.    </p>                     
<p>
Upon arrival in Luang Prabang (flight by own arrangement) you will be met by our representative who will assist you with your visa application, immigration and customs.</p>
<p>
After clearing immigration and customs, our guide will personally usher you to the charming La Residence Phou Vao Hotel.</p>
<p>
This afternoon you will start your journey in Luang Prabang, a Unesco World Heritage town. The first stop brings you to the highest point in Luang Prabang, Mount Phousi, home to a thriving Buddhist monastery. Wat Phuosi offers spectacular 360 degree views of the old town. Leaving the highest point in Luang Prabang, continue to the National Museum, formerly the Royal Palace. Constructed as a palace between 1904 and 1909 during the reign of King Sisavangvong, and now turned into a National Museum, it houses the royal throne of Lan Xang kingdom in its original splendour and many other religious treasures.</p>
 <p>
In the evening, celebrate with the locals with the traditional Baci ceremony. The Baci is a ceremony that celebrates a special event, such as a marriage, a homecoming or welcoming of visiting guests. The ceremony begins with selected individuals (usually the elderly of the village) tying strings around your wrist, believing the strings will protect the wearer. Legend has long held that these strings must not be removed for at least three days. The ceremony is heightened by the accompaniment of music and a traditional dance - both integral parts of the Baci ritual.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> La Residence Phou Vao Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>LUANG PRABANG</h5>
<p>This morning take a boat trip to the spectacular Pak Ou Caves. A jagged hole in the cliff face reveals a cave filled with hundreds of statues of the Buddha. For at least the last 500 years, kings and pilgrims have worshipped at Pak Ou's lower cave, Tham Ting. Along the way stop at the village of Baan Xanghai where they distill rice wine.</p>
<p>After a Laotian lunch, continue your adventure by car to Khoung Si Wwaterfall, a breathtaking waterfall nestled amidst primitive hilltribe villages in the mountainous jungles on the outskirts of Luang Prabang. With close proximity to the waterfall is the Khmu minority village of Ban Thapaene. Take a walk around the village for glimpse of their lifestyle.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> La Residence Phou Vao Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>LUANG PRABANG - SIEM REAP</h5>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Raffles Grand Hotel D' Angkor<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>SIEM REAP</h5>
<p>Early this morning witness the beautiful sunrise at Angkor Wat which is regarded by many as the quintessential Angkor experience.</p>
<p>
This morning see another great sight in Siem Reap, the Pink Temple, otherwise known as Banteay Srei. A 10th century Cambodian temple dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva, Banteay Srei is built largely of red sandstone, a medium that lends itself to the elaborate decorative wall carvings which are still observable today.</p>
<p>On the way to Banteay Seri, visit one of the local villages where we have helped provide a series of water wells that supply fresh water to the local village. Free flowing fresh water is a basic humanitarian necessity that the Cambodian government is currently unable to provide to all of the villages in the countryside. Through the kind and generous donations of our guests, we have been able to provide over 30 villages with fresh water under guidance of our local guide Sam. We are very proud to be affiliated to this wonderful humanitarian project.</p>
 <p>Continue your journey to the Landmine Museum and meet Aki Ra, the founder of the Cambodia Landmine Museum and National Project Manager for the CLMMRF (NGO). He began his life as a child living in the countryside prior to the Khmer Rouge Revolution. His mother and father were killed during the Pol Pot regime and he soon found himself living in a Khmer Rouge camp for children.</p>
<p>After lunch, visit Angkor Thom, the last and most enduring capital city of the Khmer empire. Standing tall within Angkor Thom is the Bayon temple which was the last state temple to be built at Angkor as well as the Terrace of the Leper King and the Terrace of the Elephants.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Raffles Grand Hotel D' Angkor<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L</p>

<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 13 days</p>
<p>A fantastic itinerary for first time visitors to the region, this programme takes in Bangkok and many of the major highlights in Cambodia and Vietnam.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong> Bangkok, Siem Reap, Ho Chi Minh City, Hue, Hoi An, Halong Bay, Hanoi.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>ARRIVE BANGKOK</h5>
<p> Your travel experience starts the minute you disembark when our representative will be right
there to breeze you through immigration and customs through a special channel dedicated to VIPS,
away from the crowd. After clearing immigration and customs, our guide will be accompanying you
to Peninsula Hotel Bangkok.</p>
<p>
Upon arrival smooth your jetlag by pampering yourself to a bath or explore the many facilities the
hotel has or just relax in the comfort of your room, whatever your heart desire. This evening is free
at your leisure.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> The Peninsula</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>BANGKOK</h5>
<p>This morning experience an important part of Thai culture by offering food to the monks at a local temple. Afterwards cruise along Chao Phraya River and canals, where you will see the family homes and temples dotted along the waterways which inspired Bangkok's reference as the "Venice of the East".</p>
<p>
Your exciting journey continues once you disembark at the public pier. Here you will take a short ride on a tuk tuk (a motorised tricycle, one of the symbols of Bangkok) to visit the Grand Palace and Emerald Buddha Temple. The complex consists of over 100 brightly coloured buildings, golden spires and glittering mosaics, and dates back to 1782 when Bangkok was founded. Wat Phra</p>
<p>Kaew (Emerald Buddha Temple) itself, is Thailand's most important and sacred temple.</p>
<p>
For lunch today, enjoy a sampling of local cuisines. Afterwards visit the Arts of the Kingdom Exhibition at the Ananda Samakhom Throne Hall (closed on Mondays). The Arts of the Kingdom is an exhibition of exquisite but rarely seen traditional Thai crafts created by artists under The Foundation for the Promotion of Supplementary Occupations and Related Techniques under the Royal Patronage of Her Majesty Queen Sirikit of Thailand.</p>
<p>Return to the hotel, the evening is at leisure.</p>

<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>BANGKOK</h5>
<p>Spend a full day exploring the floating market at Damneon Nam Saduak by bike. The biggest and most colourful floating market in Thailand, you can purchase just about anything from the vast array of "shops" on the river.</p>
<p>
Seventy kilometres southwest of Bangkok the Mae Klong River spreads into a sprawling delta before reaching the Gulf of Thailand. This low-lying land is extremely fertile and over hundreds of years the Thai people have constructed an extensive network of canals to aid irrigation and navigation.</p>
<p>
The local way of life has remained traditional and revolves around the colourful floating markets where the fruits of the surrounding orchards are traded.</p>
<p>
Drive south from Bangkok. Arriving at a riverside temple situated on the banks of the Mae Klong River, you can enjoy the beauty of the temple before the bikes are fitted and a general briefing is given.</p>
   <p>
Your bicycle ride takes you through coconut and aloe vera plantations as well as fruit orchards. Riding quiet back roads and jeep trails you will stop to visit interesting temples and appreciate the countryside. Depending on the season, you will see grapes, lychee, pomelo, guava and coconuts ripe for picking.</p>
<p>
One of the temples you will visit is the Wat Bang Kung. This quirky temple is held up by a huge banyan tree but you can still step inside and see the Buddha image. This temple is housed in the old Bang Kung army camp which was used to garrison soldiers when regaining Thailand's independence from Burma. Also visit the exceptional temple of Wat Bang Kae Noi where the inside of the Wat has carved panels depicting the story of the enlightenment of Buddha.</p>
<p>
After a delicious Thai lunch at a riverside restaurant, continue cycling on picturesque trails through lush vegetation towards the starting point of the floating market.</p>
<p>Spend time browsing the shops before transferring back to Bangkok.</p>

<p>
Boeng Mealea is located 63 kilometres east of Siem Reap. The temple wasconstructed in the early 11th century. The temple is pre-Angkorian, it is a Hindu temple. The temple is largely overrun by vegetation. Constructed in a distinctly Angkor Wat style under the same king that built Angkor Wat, Boeng Mealea may have served as a prototype of sorts.</p>
<p>
Koh Ker is located about 100 kilometres from Siem Reap and about 40 kilometres north of Boeng Mealea temple. It was constructed between 928-944 by King Jayavarman IV who raised an impressive royal city at Koh Ker with Brahmanic monuments, temples and prasats, surrounding a huge baray ( reservoir ). Jayavarman IV reigned at Koh Ker for 20 years before he died in 941.</p>

<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>SIEM REAP</h5>
<p>This morning witness another great sight in Siem Reap. Known to many as the pink temple, Banteay Srei is a 10th century temple dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva. Banteay Srei is built largely of red sandstone, a medium that lends itself to the elaborate decorative wall carvings which are still observable today.</p>
<p>
On the way to Banteay Seri, travel with our guide to visit one of the local villages where we have helped provide a series of water wells that supply fresh water to the local village. Free flowing fresh water is a basic humanitarian necessity that the Cambodian government is currently unable to provide to all of the villages in the countryside. Through the kind and generous donations of our guests, we have been able to provide over 30 villages with fresh water under guidance of our local guide Sam. We are very proud to be affiliated to this wonderful humanitarian project.</p>
 <p>
Continue to the Landmine Museum and meet with Aki Ra, the founder of the Cambodia Landmine Museum and National Project Manager for the CLMMRF (NGO). He began his life as a child living in the countryside prior to the Khmer Rouge Revolution. His mother and father were killed during the Pol Pot regime and he soon found himself living in a Khmer Rouge camp for children.</p>
<p>
Return to the hotel at midday to relax. After lunch, visit Angkor Thom, the last and most enduring capital city of the Khmer empire. Standing tall within Angkor Thom is the Bayon temple which was the last state temple to be built at Angkor. Within the Bayon lies the Terrace of the Leper King and the Terrace of Elephants.</p>

<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 6 days</p>
<p>A fascinating introduction to Cambodia - a land of ancient cultures and modern day atrocities.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong> Siem Reap, Angkor Wat, Phnom Penh. </p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>ARRIVE SIEM REAP</h5>
<p>Your travel experience starts the minute you disembark when our representative will be there to breeze you through immigration and customs through a special channel. After clearing immigration and customs, our guide will accompany you to the legendary Raffles Grand Hotel d'Angkor.</p>
<p>
After a traditional Khmer lunch, get an insight into Angkor through Darryl Collins, a leading expert in Khmer history. His passion for Asian arts brought him to Cambodia in 1994 with a team of experts from the National Gallery of Australia to work with an Australian government-funded project assisting the National Museum of Cambodia in Phnom Penh. Drawing on the knowledge that he gained in Cambodia and his passion for Asian arts, he lectures at the Department of Archaeology at the Royal University of Fine Arts in Phnom Penh.  Besides lecturing he spends the rest of his time writing  about art, architecture and culture.</p>
<p>
Late afternoon, visit Angkor Wat, the largest of the Khmer monuments. Built around the first half of the 12th century by King Suryavarman II, the temple's balance, composition and beauty make it one of the finest monuments in the world.</p>
<p>This evening before dinner join the children from a local orphanage for a traditional folk dance.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Raffles Grand Hotel d' Angkor<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> L</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>SIEM REAP</h5>
<p>Early morning witness the beautiful sunrise at Angkor Wat which is regarded by many as the quintessential Angkor experience.
</p>
<p>
After breakfast, continue to another great sight. Known to many as the pink temple, Banteay Srei is a 10th century temple dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva. Banteay Srei is built largely of red sandstone, a medium that lends itself to the elaborate decorative wall carvings which are still observable today.</p>
<p>
On the way to Banteay Seri, visit one of the local villages where we have helped provide a series of water wells that supply fresh water to the local village. Free flowing fresh water is a basic humanitarian necessity that the Cambodian government is currently unable to provide to all of the villages in the countryside. Through the kind and generous donations of our guests, we have been able to provide over 30 villages with fresh water under guidance of our local guide Sam. We are very proud to be affiliated to this wonderful humanitarian project</p>
 <p>
Continue your journey to the Landmine Museum and meet Aki Ra, founder of the Cambodia Landmine Museum and National Project Manager for the CLMMRF (NGO). He began his life as a child living in the countryside prior to the Khmer Rouge Revolution. His mother and father were killed during the Pol Pot regime and he soon found himself living in a Khmer Rouge camp for children.</p>
<p>
Return to the hotel at midday for some time to relax. After lunch, visit Angkor Thom, the last and most enduring capital city of the Khmer empire. Standing tall within Angkor Thom is the Bayon temple which was the last state temple to be built at Angkor and it's here that the Terrace of the Leper King and the Terrace of Elephants can be seen.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Raffles Grand Hotel d' Angkor<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>SIEM REAP</h5>
<p>
After breakfast, begin by visiting Little Circuit, the route comprising Victory Gate, Thommanon, Chau Say Tevoda, Spean Thma, Takeo, Ta Prohm, Banteay Kdei and Prasat Kravan. </p>
<p>
Move on to the Grand Circuit, a royal city forming a rectangle of 700 by 800 metres, surrounded by a moat similar to Ta Prohm but only with four enclosures.</p>
<p>
After lunch at local restaurant, you will embark on a boat to visit the floating village of Tonle Sap. The residents of the floating village reside on houses which stay afloat on the river and the lake. An unusual characteristic of this river is that its water flow changes, depending on the season. As the rainy season sets in and as the water level rises, the residents move their houses by boat closer to shore. During the dry season, they again move their houses towards the lake.</p>
<p>
The river links the Mekong River to the southern end of the Great Lake. The lake was the lifeline of the Khmers as it served as a source of fish and rice to the agrarian society.</p>
<p>
After that transfer to Artisans D'Angkor which was created to help young people find work in their home villages, allowing them to practice their crafts and providing them with a vocation and a role in society. Artisans D' Angkor has renewed Khmer cultural identity and showcases traditional Cambodiam workmanship.</p>

<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>SIEM REAP - PHNOM PENH</h5>
<p> After breakfast your guide will accompany you to Siem Reap airport for your flight to Phnom Penh. After clearing immigration and customs upon arrival in the Cambodian capital, you will be will be transferred to Raffles Hotel Phnom Penh.</p>
<p>
In the afternoon, you will visit the The Royal Palace. The structure you will be seeing today was constructed earlier this century on the site of the Banteay Kev, a citadel built in 1813. The structure is strongly influenced by the Royal Palace and the Royal Temple in Bangkok. Visitors are only allowed to go inside the Palace's Silver Pagoda and its surrounding compound.</p>
<p>
The Silver Pagoda, also known as Wat Preah Keo, was given its name because of over 5,000 silver tiles weighing 1 kilogram each that cover the floor.</p>
<p>
Continue to the the National Museum of Khmer Art and Archaeology, otherwise known as "Musee des Beaux-Arts" or "Musee Albert Sarraut". This museum is considered to be one of the finest museums of classical Cambodian art.</p>
<p>
The Russian Market is popular among tourists, local expatriates and Cambodians alike. Located in southern Phnom Penh it is so called because of its popularity among Russian expatriates during the 1980s.</p>

Visit the adjacent Maasai village, take a morning bush walk with an armed ranger or enjoy sundowners in the evening or even dinner under the stars in the middle of the African bush.<br /><br />In the Mara, the wildlife is abundant and the swaying grasslands ensure that animals are never out of sight. Elephants browse amongst the large herds of wildebeest, topi, gazelle, eland and buffalo. The plains offer a rich variety of food for the dominant predators: lion, leopard, hyena and cheetah. In the Mara River, hippos submerge while crocodiles sunbathe on the riverbanks.<br /><br />Around July to September, rain depending, the Masai Mara is host to the famous wildebeest migration which is one of the few remaining mass migrations of mammals in the world. During this time herds of over a million wildebeest will trawl their way through this region and they become the major focus for predatory activity and drama unfolds at every corner.<br /><br />There are also options for a morning balloon safari or a half-day visit to Lake Victoria.<br /><br />Balloon Safari: As the balloon is inflated against the first rays of sunrise your pilot will go through safety procedures. Once aloft, the balloon floats gently over the plains, giving a bird's eye view of the game below as the sun creeps slowly over the horizon. After around one hour the balloon lands as breakfast is already being prepared and, of course, enjoy a glass or two of bubbly to toast your flight in a tradition initiated by the Montgolfier brothers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lake Victoria Adventure : An early start this morning with a transfer to the airstrip for a flight by light aircraft to Lake Victoria. On arrival enjoy an appetising full English breakfast before you board the boat for the morning. There will be the opportunity to try fishing for the legendary giant Nile perch found in these waters as you explore the myriad of tiny islands in this region of the lake. An experienced and knowledgeable fisherman captains each boat. There is the chance to stop at a traditional fishing village and see how the villagers live from day to day before returning to the airstrip for your return flight to the Masai Mara.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p>";
