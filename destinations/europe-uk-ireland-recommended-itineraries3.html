<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong>  9 days </p>
<p>A 9-day itinerary featuring the highlights of Scotland, arriving to and departing from Edinburgh</p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong> Edinburgh, the Borders of Scotland, Perth, Fort William, Loch Ness, Isle of Skye, Loch Lomond, Gleneagles, Glamis, St. Andrews</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>Arrive Edinburgh</h5>
<p>Upon arrival at Edinburgh airport you will be met in the arrivals hall by your local representative and privately transferred to your hotel. Your representative will assist you with check-in procedures.</p>
<p> <strong>Overnight:</strong> Balmoral Hotel</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Edinburgh</h5>
<p>This morning, you will meet an expert local guide for a full day sightseeing tour of Scotland's capital city by private vehicle. You will first head up to Edinburgh Castle, where you will see the 'Honours of Scotland', the Scottish Crown Jewels, and obtain stunning views of the city. You will then continue down the Royal Mile, past St. Giles High Kirk, to Holyrood Palace, the Queen's official residence in Scotland. You will tour the staterooms of the palace if no member of the Royal Family is staying here at the time.</p>
 <p>
This afternoon, start by visiting the National Gallery of Scotland where a curator will take you on a tour of the highlights. Later you will drive down to the city docks at Leith, where you will board the former Royal Yacht Britannia, now permanently moored here, for a semi-private early evening tour. Built in Scotland, this ship was used by the Royal Family for many official voyages during her working life.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Balmoral Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>The Borders of Scotland</h5>
<p>You will meet your driver-guide who will take you on a full day excursion into the Scottish Borders in a vintage Rolls Royce or Daimler vehicle. The River Tweed, one of the finest salmon rivers in Britain, runs through this area of pleasant hills and rolling agricultural land. This is Walter Scott Country, and you will visit his house at Abbotsford. Still owned by his descendants, you can see where the novelist worked and look at some of his memorabilia. You will also visit the nearby woollen mill town of Melrose, site of one of the region's many ruined abbey churches.</p>
<p>
Later, you will visit Traquair House, the oldest inhabited house in Scotland.  Known for its gates that will remain shut until a member of the Stuart family sits again on the British throne, this house boasts its own brewery. On your return to Edinburgh you may also visit Rosslyn Chapel, this small but very ornately carved church has achieved fame recently as a location featured in 'The Da Vinci Code'.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Balmoral Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>Edinburgh - Perth - Fort William</h5>
<p>Your driver-guide will take you on a full day journey by private vehicle into the Highlands of Scotland.  You will make your first stop in Perth, where you will be able to visit Scone Palace, a mansion built on the site of the coronation of the medieval kings of Scotland. Continue north into the Scottish Highlands, and stop to visit the Edradour Scotch whisky distillery, the smallest in Scotland, where you will be treated to a tasting of various malts of different ages. Afterwards you will continue to your hotel in Fort William, one of the main towns in the region. You will be confirmed for 3 nights at Inverlochy Castle, the finest country house hotel in Scotland.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Inverlochy Castle<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>Loch Ness and the Great Glen</h5>
<p> Today you will see some of Scotland's best-known places on a full day journey to Fort William with your driver-guide and private vehicle.  Drive along the River Ness until you reach Loch Ness, home of the fabled monster. You can visit the ruins of Urquhart Castle that dominate the deepest part of the lake. If you prefer, why not take a privately-chartered cruise on a boat which has sonar equipment on board to scan for mysterious objects in the water.</p>
<p>
Continue to Inverness, where you will cross the battlefield of Culloden Moor, scene of the battle where Bonnie Prince Charlie was defeated in 1746 by government troops. On the return journey to Fort William, you may like to take the gondola up the Aonach Mor slope of Ben Nevis, Britain's highest mountain.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Inverlochy Castle<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>The Isle of Skye</h5>
<p>Your driver-guide will lead you on a full day excursion to the Isle of Skye. The route starts by heading northwest over the mountains to Glen Shiel, the valley that will lead you to the West Coast.  In Loch Duich, you will visit the romantic Eilean Donan Castle, pictured on many postcards from Scotland.</p>
<p>
You will then drive over the bridge to the Isle of Skye, where you will still see road signs in the Gaelic language. Weather permitting you will obtain fine views of the Cuillin Hills in the centre of the island. Pause to obtain a flavour of the Gaelic heritage at the Clan Donald Centre. Lunch may be taken at Kinloch Lodge, the restaurant owned by Lady Claire MacDonald, one of Scotland's leading cookery writers.</p>
<p>

Visit the adjacent Maasai village, take a morning bush walk with an armed ranger or enjoy sundowners in the evening or even dinner under the stars in the middle of the African bush.<br /><br />In the Mara, the wildlife is abundant and the swaying grasslands ensure that animals are never out of sight. Elephants browse amongst the large herds of wildebeest, topi, gazelle, eland and buffalo. The plains offer a rich variety of food for the dominant predators: lion, leopard, hyena and cheetah. In the Mara River, hippos submerge while crocodiles sunbathe on the riverbanks.<br /><br />Around July to September, rain depending, the Masai Mara is host to the famous wildebeest migration which is one of the few remaining mass migrations of mammals in the world. During this time herds of over a million wildebeest will trawl their way through this region and they become the major focus for predatory activity and drama unfolds at every corner.<br /><br />There are also options for a morning balloon safari or a half-day visit to Lake Victoria.<br /><br />Balloon Safari: As the balloon is inflated against the first rays of sunrise your pilot will go through safety procedures. Once aloft, the balloon floats gently over the plains, giving a bird's eye view of the game below as the sun creeps slowly over the horizon. After around one hour the balloon lands as breakfast is already being prepared and, of course, enjoy a glass or two of bubbly to toast your flight in a tradition initiated by the Montgolfier brothers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lake Victoria Adventure : An early start this morning with a transfer to the airstrip for a flight by light aircraft to Lake Victoria. On arrival enjoy an appetising full English breakfast before you board the boat for the morning. There will be the opportunity to try fishing for the legendary giant Nile perch found in these waters as you explore the myriad of tiny islands in this region of the lake. An experienced and knowledgeable fisherman captains each boat.

</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>ARRIVE IN BATH</h5>
<p>You are met at the airport by your private representative after which you will be transferred to your hotel in the heart of Georgian Bath.</p>
<p>
Your local representative will meet you at the hotel reception and assist you with checking in. He/she will run through your itinerary with you and answer any questions you may have. Your representative is then available by telephone throughout your vacation to answer any queries.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Royal Crescent Hotel</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>EXPLORE GEORGIAN BATH</h5>
<p> This morning you will take a walking tour with a local guide to explore the beautiful Georgian city of Bath, often regarded as one of the loveliest cities in all of England.</p>
<p>From its beginnings as a Roman camp in the first century AD, Bath developed through troubled centuries to emerge in the 1700's as a fashionable "spa" resort. Some of England's best-preserved Georgian architecture is housed here, together with fascinating relics of earlier eras. Visit the Roman Baths that were discovered in an excellent state of preservation near to Bath Abbey church and also see the magnificent Palladian architecture for which the city is renowned, seen at its best in the Circus and the Royal Crescent.

<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>BATH-STONEHENGE-COTSWOLDS</h5>
<p>You will be joined this morning by a guide for a tour by private vehicle across the English countryside. You will head first to Salisbury, stopping to admire the thirteenth-century cathedral that boasts the highest medieval spire in England and also to visit the Chapter House, to see the best preserved of the four surviving original copies of the Magna Carta. Continue afterwards past the hill of Old Sarum on your way up to the Salisbury Plain. Here you will visit Stonehenge, arguably the most famous prehistoric site in Europe, it inspires wonder at the effort it must have taken to drag the enormous stones over the land and erect them in circles.</p>
<p>From here, drive north into the Cotswold Hills to reach Little Faringdon House, the country house reserved exclusively for you for the next 4 nights. You are welcomed by the house staff, and this evening you will be served dinner in the elegant dining room.</p>
<p>Little Faringdon House is a grade II listed Cotswold house with a mile long driveway set in private parkland. Sleeping up to 18 in 9 en-suite rooms, the estate is ideal for extended families and friends to explore and relax at leisure in quintessential English countryside.</p>

<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>AT HOME IN THE COTSWOLDS</h5>
<p> Peel away your crisp cotton sheets from your four-poster bed, hop into a luxurious bubble bath and head downstairs where your breakfast awaits you. Feeling fully recharged escape with your rental car to start the southern section of the Romantic Road of the Cotswolds.
</p>
<p>The first day will be spent exploring Lechlade, a bustling little town where Kelmscott Manor can be found, an old Cotswold manor house that was owned by William Morris, the founder of the 19th century Arts & Crafts movement. Situated on the south side of the Thames is a delightful example of a neo-classical country mansion, Buscot Park, interestingly once home to Lord Faringdon and a fantastic series of murals painstakingly produced by the Pre-Raphaelite painter Edward Burne-Jones. Before heading back to your own country pad why not hire a boat on the River Thames?</p>
<p>Following dinner enjoy a film in your very own cinema room equipped with comfy armchairs and sofas.</p>

<h5>THE SOUTHERN COTSWOLDS</h5>
<p> Back on the winding country roads your next stop is Fairford which boasts a fine example of a 15th century Cotswold wool church, built on the proceeds of the medieval wool trade. The church is unique for its nearly complete set of ornate medieval painted windows depicting biblical stories.</p>
<p>From here head to the chocolate box village of Bibury, one of the most photographed of all of the villages in England where quaint cottages, such as those in Arlington Row, date from the 14th century. Whilst exploring the pretty streets the local Trout Farm is well worth a visit and a stop off for afternoon tea next to the river shouldn't be missed.
</p>
<p>Prior to the evening meal why not explore the private parkland that belongs to the house, which includes ponds, a lake, an orchard and beautiful walks along the River Leach.</p>

<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>BURFORD &AMP; CIRENCESTER</h5>
<p>Prior to continuing on the Romantic Road make a quick detour to Burford just 10 minutes drive away from Little Faringdon House. Burford was voted the 6th most idyllic destination in Europe by Forbes in 2009. Burford High Street sweeps down the hill towards the River Windrush and is lined with many interesting shops, including antiques shops, where souvenirs can be purchased. One of the local pubs is a great spot to sample some local cuisine for your lunch prior to heading to the self-styled capital of the Cotswolds, Cirencester.
</p>
<p>Cirencester dates back to Roman times, local artifacts and mosaics from which can be found on display at the fascinating Corinium Museum. A great selection of elegant shops allows for another opportunity to pick up some souvenirs. Alternatively stop off at Barnsley House (now a luxury hotel) which has one of the best-loved gardens in England, created by renowned horticulturalist Rosemary Verey. To complete the Romantic Road head back to Little Faringdon House via the town of Painswick, known for its immaculate 99 yew trees in the churchyard.</p>

Visit the adjacent Maasai village, take a morning bush walk with an armed ranger or enjoy sundowners in the evening or even dinner under the stars in the middle of the African bush.<br /><br />In the Mara, the wildlife is abundant and the swaying grasslands ensure that animals are never out of sight. Elephants browse amongst the large herds of wildebeest, topi, gazelle, eland and buffalo. The plains offer a rich variety of food for the dominant predators: lion, leopard, hyena and cheetah. In the Mara River, hippos submerge while crocodiles sunbathe on the riverbanks.<br /><br />Around July to September, rain depending, the Masai Mara is host to the famous wildebeest migration which is one of the few remaining mass migrations of mammals in the world. During this time herds of over a million wildebeest will trawl their way through this region and they become the major focus for predatory activity and drama unfolds at every corner.<br /><br />There are also options for a morning balloon safari or a half-day visit to Lake Victoria.<br /><br />Balloon Safari: As the balloon is inflated against the first rays of sunrise your pilot will go through safety procedures. Once aloft, the balloon floats gently over the plains, giving a bird's eye view of the game below as the sun creeps slowly over the horizon. After around one hour the balloon lands as breakfast is already being prepared and, of course, enjoy a glass or two of bubbly to toast your flight in a tradition initiated by the Montgolfier brothers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lake Victoria Adventure : An early start this morning with a transfer to the airstrip for a flight by light aircraft to Lake Victoria. On arrival enjoy an appetising full English breakfast before you board the boat for the morning. There will be the opportunity to try fishing for the legendary giant Nile perch found in these waters as you explore the myriad of tiny islands in this region of the lake. An experienced and knowledgeable fisherman captains each boat.
