<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5> Arrive Hanoi</h5>
<p>On arrival in Hanoi you are met by a representative of A&K and assisted with immigration and luggage claim before transferring to the hotel. The rest of the day is at leisure. </p>
<p><strong>overnight :</strong> Sofitel Legend Metropole Hanoi (Premium)</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Hanoi</h5>
<p>A full day to experience Hanoi. First stop the Temple of Literature. In 1076 Quoc Tu Giam - Vietnam's first university, also referred to as Van Mieu, was established within a temple to educate Vietnam's royalty and members of the elite. The university functioned for an incredible 700 years and its gardens and well-preserved architecture offer a fascinating glimpse into Vietnam's past.</p>
<p>
On next to the local Hang Be market where most of the ingredients used in Vietnamese cooking come from. After sourcing the produce there is a cooking class where the whole family can learn to make Vietnamese spring rolls with a local chef and enjoy some local specialties for lunch.</p>
<p>
In the afternoon visit the fascinating Ethnology Museum, a public museum with both indoor and outdoor exhibits dedicated to the many ethnic groups of Vietnam. Finish the day with some of Hanoi's best homemade ice cream - a legacy of the French in Vietnam!</p>
<p>
This evening watch a traditional water puppet show, a uniquely northern Vietnamese art form especially designed for depicting scenes from rural life and episodes of national history. Marvel as the puppets are made to leap on water, light tiny fireworks and even have a swimming race.</p>
<p>
As an alternative to the Temple of Literature you may instead like to visit Bat Trang Pottery Village to the east of Hanoi. Famous for its blue and white pottery, much of today's Bat Trang pottery is made in moulds and hand painted in family style businesses which consume the whole village. The main street is lined with shops and just about every household is involved in the production. Once here you'll be taken through the village by buffalo cart then into a workshop where pottery can be hand painted to any design and taken home - a great activity for the whole family.</p> 
<p><strong>overnight :</strong> Sofitel Legend Metropole Hanoi (Premium)<br />
<strong>Mean Plan :</strong>B,L</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>Hanoi - Halong Bay</h5>
<p>After breakfast, depart for Halong Bay, a 3.5-hour drive. Along the way, you will pass through the rich farmlands of the Red River Delta, observing the everyday life of Vietnamese villagers as they work in the rice fields, take pigs to the market on motorbikes and plough the fields with their water buffaloes. Arrive at the pier and transfer to your private junk for the Halong Bay cruise. Lunch is served on board as you cruise into the Bay passing rock formations with names such as Sail, Dog and Dinh Huong (incense pot). As the sun sets, the boat will drop anchor for the night and dinner will be served on board </p>
<p><strong>overnight :</strong> Indochina Junks - Prince (Deluxe)<br />
<strong>Mean Plan :</strong>B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5> Halong Bay</h5>
<p>After breakfast board a smaller motorboat to explore one of many options in the bay, including floating villages, towering islands, limestone caves and the occasional sandy beach. Itineraries vary depending on the weather and the tides. Enjoy lunch while your guide explains more about Ha Long culture and its rich natural beauty. In the afternoon visit another fishing village by kayak, nearby caves, go for a swim or cruise through the maze of islands before returning to the boat </p>
<p><strong>overnight :</strong> Indochina Junks - Prince (Deluxe)<br />
<strong>Mean Plan :</strong>B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>Halong Bay - Hanoi - Danang - Hoi An </h5>
<p>Return to the dock and disembark after breakfast. You are met and transferred to the airport for the flight to Danang. On arrival in Danang transfer by road to Hoi An, a major Asian trading port in the 17th and 18th centuries whose architecture and relaxed lifestyle has changed little over the years </p>
<p><strong>overnight :</strong> Victoria Hoi An Beach Resort & Spa (Deluxe Beach Front)<br />
<strong>Mean Plan :</strong>B,L</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>Hoi An</h5>
<p>Hoi An is a charming destination with two faces - the old-world trading port of narrow streets and traditional houses, and the beach with its new resorts and long stretches of clean white sand. In keeping with Hoi An's heritage as a trading port, the town's tiny shop-houses now host a range of craft shops and artisans including some of Asia's best tailors. Despite the passing of 200 years and the ravages of weather and war, the centre of Hoi An remains much the same as it was in its heyday.</p>
<p>This morning take a cyclo tour of the ancient town centre to visit former merchants' houses, the 400 year-old Japanese Bridge, a Chinese communal hall and the colorful market. Rest of the afternoon at leisure.</p>
<p><strong>overnight :</strong> Victoria Hoi An Beach Resort & Spa (Deluxe Beach Front)<br />
<strong>Mean Plan :</strong>B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>Hoi An</h5>
<p>Depart from hotel to the centre of Hoi An. From here ride a bicycle to a local farm in Tra Que Village. Take a trip around the vegetable garden and join the farmers in preparing the land and fertilising it with seaweed. Continue gardening activities such as raking, sowing, watering greens, picking greens etc. Afterwards you will be shown how to prepare tam huu, a local delicacy before sitting down for a home cooked meal including banh xeo a speciality savoury pancake wrapped in rice paper before the ride back to Hoi An .</p>
<p><strong>overnight :</strong> Victoria Hoi An Beach Resort & Spa (Deluxe Beach Front)<br />
<strong>Mean Plan :</strong>B,L</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 8</h4>
<h5> Hoi An - Danang - Nha Trang</h5>
<p>Transfer to Da Nang Airport after breakfast for the short flight to Nha Trang, a classic seaside town. Transfer to your resort which sits on dramatic Ninh Van Bay, with its impressive rock formations overlooking the East Vietnam Sea, white sand beach and towering mountains behind. The rest of the day is at leisure.
</p>
<p><strong>overnight :</strong> Six Senses Ninh Van Bay (Beachfront Pool Villa)<br />
<strong>Mean Plan :</strong>B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 9 - 10</h4>

<p><strong>overnight :</strong> Six Senses Ninh Van Bay (Beachfront Pool Villa)<br />
<strong>Mean Plan :</strong>B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 11</h4>
<h5>Nha Trang - Ho Chi Minh City</h5>
<p>Fly from Nha Trang to Ho Chi Minh City, still called Saigon by the locals.</p>
<p>On arrival drive 1.5-hours to Cu Chi (as an optional extra, the journey can be taken by speedboat along the Saigon River). Leaving the city behind, the scenery changes to views of rice paddies, villagers drying noodles by the side of the road and other scenes typical to southern Vietnam. The famous Cu Chi Tunnels consist of an incredible underground tunnel network constructed by Vietnamese resistance fighters (Viet Cong) during both the French and American wars.</p>
<p>Close by is the Wildlife at Risk (WAR) rescue centre, the first multi-species wildlife hospital and holding facility in southern Vietnam.

<h4>Day 12</h4>
<h5>Ho Chi Minh City - Mekong Delta</h5>
<p>The Cuu Long region, which translates as 'Nine Dragons', otherwise known as the Mekong Delta is a great place to discover Vietnam. Amazing waterways hidden amongst vibrant tropical fruit gardens, bustling floating markets that offer a cornucopia of items and acres of emerald rice fields are what make this region so unforgettable.</p>
<p>
After breakfast, depart for the Mekong Delta. Leave the hustle and bustle of the city behind as you travel through Vietnam's picturesque countryside with its rice paddies and rural villages. Upon arrival in the Delta board the private 'Song Xanh', modeled after a traditional sampan. The boat's small size allows you to discover the smaller canals and tributaries of this region. Your visit includes the home of Mr. Huyen Thuy Le, a character from the novel 'The Lover' by Marguerite Duras as well as Thien Hau Pagoda. Return to the boat for lunch. Continue to Can Tho stopping en-route at a Cao Dai Temple. Cao Daism is indigenous to South Vietnam and the colorful and unusual murals that cover the temple's interior are blinding with their brilliance.</p>
<p>
Before sunset, the last stop is at a splendid 19th century house where an unforgettable candlelight dinner will be served. Afterwards, proceed for one hour to Can Tho where your sampan will be mooring for the night</p>

The main items sold here are fruit and vegetables and every boat has a long upright pole at its bow on which samples of the goods for sale are hung. The waterway becomes a maze of hundreds of boats packed with mango, bananas, papaya, pineapple, and even floating pho vendors.</p>

<strong>Mean Plan :</strong> B,L,D
</p>

<p>Phnom Penh was once the Paris of the East. Despite its rapid development, it has retained a lot of its rustic charm and elegance. After breakfast, there is a captivating lecture on Cambodia's modern history followed by a city tour of this dynamic, historical capital which has managed to preserve huge slices of its French colonial allure. Sightseeing in the morning will include visiting the dazzling white and gold edifice of the Royal Palace and the Silver Pagoda and exceptionally beautiful Khmer craft at the National Museum.</p>

<p>A tour is included of the rural Angkor Ban village where time has stood still. The houses are rustic, made by hand and without any concrete. But most of all, it is the unbridled warmth of the villagers which is overwhelming. Guests can take part in the daily activities of the villagers to experience village life first hand. Then return to the ship to cruise towards Kampong Cham </p>
<p><strong>Overnight :</strong> Jayavarman (Deluxe Cabin) <br />
<strong>Mean Plan :</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>Kampong Cham - Wat Hanchey</h5>
<p>Wake in the small hours of the morning for a land journey to the pre-Angkorian temple of Wat Hanchey. Travellers either take a motor-taxi or climb the 291 steps to the top. Located at the top of a hill overlooking the river, it offers one of the most breathtaking views in Cambodia. Built in the 8th century, this ancient structure, together with a bigger and newer addition underscores the superb architecture of the Chenla Empire which predates the mighty Angkor temple complex. There is even an opportunity to engage in light banter with some of the monks in the area. Return to the ship to witness a blessing ceremony performed by orange-clad local monks.
When the tide allows, there is a surprise sojourn in the Zodiacs (inflatable boats) to the nearby beach to swim in the tea-coloured Mekong river, an experience that will, no doubt, dominate dinner conversations in the weeks to come.</p>
<p>The cruise continues towards Kampong Cham to visit Wat Nokor, a wat built within the ruins of an ancient temple. On the way back to the ship, guests visit an orphanage and manoeuvre a 2km rickety bamboo bridge balance</p>
<p><strong>Overnight :</strong> Jayavarman (Deluxe Cabin) <br />
<strong>Mean Plan :</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4> Day 7</h4>
<h5> Kampong Cham - Kampong Chhnang</h5>
<p>Before the sun peeks over the horizon, the cruiser sets sail towards Kampong Chhnang on the Tonle Sap River - an amazingly narrow river - which glides through leafy swaths of the south-east Asian jungle. Cacophonous children greet the boat waving enthusiastically as they bring their livestock for a bath in the meandering Tonle Sap River. Kampong Chhnang is Cambodia's "waterworld" where everything is on stilts balanced on rich water rich soil. A motorboat excursion to the landing is followed by a short bus trip to see the Khmer-styled pottery at the Aundaung Russey village. Then, it is back to the river for a motorboat excursion to the wetlands, floating houses and fish farms of the region.</p>
<p>
Return to the ship and cruise the narrow and meandering Tonle Sap. The water levels here rise and drop considerably throughout the year which dictates the itinerary schedule.</p>
<p><strong>High Water Programme (approx. August-mid December)</strong><br />
The vessel cruises this afternoon along the narrow and meandering Tonle Sap (B,L,D).</p>
<p>
<strong>Low Water Programme (approx. mid December- August/September)</strong> <br />
On arrival at Kampong Tralach, disembark to a traditional ox cart rally before being introduced to the Heritage Line "literacy project". This is the day to truly experience rural Khmer life.
This evening a sumptious spread will be served before a chance to participate in some Cambodian dancing.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight :</strong> Jayavarman (Deluxe Cabin) <br />
<strong>Mean Plan :</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 8</h4>
<h5>Tonle Sap - Siem Riep</h5>
<p>This great lake dominates Cambodia and is the largest freshwater lake in Asia with abundant birdlife. This lake is so wide that its shores cannot be seen from the middle of the lake. Enjoy the stillness of the water and the quiet tranquility on the way to Siem Reap. 
The water level varies a great deal according to the time of the year and the amount of rainfall recorded. Thus, minor changes to the itinerary may occur during different seasons.
The cruise comes to an end as the ship reaches Siem Reap, home to the fabled Angkor temple complex </p>

During this time herds of over a million wildebeest will trawl their way through this region and they become the major focus for predatory activity and drama unfolds at every corner.<br /><br />There are also options for a morning balloon safari or a half-day visit to Lake Victoria.<br /><br />Balloon Safari: As the balloon is inflated against the first rays of sunrise your pilot will go through safety procedures. Once aloft, the balloon floats gently over the plains, giving a bird's eye view of the game below as the sun creeps slowly over the horizon. After around one hour the balloon lands as breakfast is already being prepared and, of course, enjoy a glass or two of bubbly to toast your flight in a tradition initiated by the Montgolfier brothers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lake Victoria Adventure : An early start this morning with a transfer to the airstrip for a flight by light aircraft to Lake Victoria. On arrival enjoy an appetising full English breakfast before you board the boat for the morning. There will be the opportunity to try fishing for the legendary giant Nile perch found in these waters as you explore the myriad of tiny islands in this region of the lake.

Near the dining area a large baobab tree shades the swimming pool in which guests can escape the heat of the sun or cool off after a game walk.<br /></p>";

Enjoy the solitude whilst observing elephants, lions, buffalo, hippos and crocodiles. Game drives are conducted by 4WD vehicles or from your river boat, the more adventurous of you may like to stretch your legs with a walking safari.<br /><br />The Selous Game Reserve is the largest game reserve in the world and has some of the finest virgin bush left in Africa, where the last of the really big-tusked elephants and large-maned lions roam. The Selous supports around one million game animals, is bigger than Switzerland and is a World Heritage site. From March to May floods sweep the valley, forcing the game on to the 'islands' of higher ground, where elephant, buffalo, lion, leopard, crocodile, puku, buck, eland, sable and others concentrate.<br /></p>";

You may like to explore the Selous overland by 4WD vehicle or on a bush walk, or take to the river on a boat trip. Alternatively you may like to relax at your camp with a book on your private verandah or cool off in the camp's pool.<br /><br />The Selous is Africa's largest wildlife sanctuary and one of its least known treasures. Covering 21,000 square miles of completely undeveloped land, the Selous is one of the last great tracts of true wilderness left in Africa.<br /></p>";

Upon arrival at Arusha airport you will be met by your private driver/guide who will escort you for the duration of your safari in Tanzania. Transfer from Arusha to Ngorongoro Crater Lodge located on the rim with spectacular views across the crater. The Ngorongoro Crater is the largest unbroken caldera in the world and the first sight of it is breathtaking.<br /><br />Ngorongoro Crater Lodge is situated on the edge of the ancient crater rim above the cool, swirling mists. The lodge is a return to the noble elegance of the travelling colonials. Inspired in design by the Maasai Manyatta, three separate camps of 6 to 12 suites each remember a bygone era when characters such as Lord Delamere adorned the stilted, handcrafted structures with graceful antiques, grand chandeliers and treasures collected from travels through Africa.<br /><br /></p>";

From your lodge on the crater rim descend to the crater floor by 4WD safari vehicle for a morning unlike any other you will experience in Africa. Spot some of the rarer species in Africa like the black rhino against the spectacular backdrop of the crater's forest covered walls. Enjoy a picnic lunch amongst the hippos and birds before visiting a Maasai village this afternoon.<br /><br />The floor of the crater is only 100 sq miles but is home to around 30,000 animals with a high concentration of predators and some of the finest black-maned lions in Africa. Rhinos can often be seen with calves at heel. Eland and waterbuck appear not to notice the human visitors, enabling photographers to shoot at ease. On the lake in the middle of the crater you may see thousands of flamingos fluttering and shimmering like a pink heat haze. Zebra and wildebeest account for almost half the animals. Gazelle, buffalo, eland, hartebeest and wart hog can also be seen.<br /></p>";

After a picnic lunch continue to your camp located in the southern reaches of Serengeti National Park.<br /><br />Kusini Camp is built in and around a large kopje. The camp offers spectacular views across Tortillis woodland situated on the edge of the short grass plains. The camp is comprised of nine double tents scattered around the kopje with the mess tent and common area as the central feature. Privacy between tents is guaranteed as they are at a substantial distance from each other and are generally concealed by a tree or kopje.<br /></p>";
