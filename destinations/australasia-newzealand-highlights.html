<dt><h2>Auckland</h2> 
<p>Auckland brims with natural beauty and sightseeing attractions making it one of the most visited cities in New Zealand. An amazing city boasting of an urban environment where everyone lives within half an hour of beautiful beaches, hiking trails and a dozen enchanted holiday islands. New Zealand's most diverse city features a vibrant Polynesian culture, sun drenched sidewalks & parks, buzzing shopping centers and a range of fine dining restaurants and bars.

</p>
<div class="thepet"><p>Auckland is surrounded by volcanic hills and is home to twin harbors that render it the title of "The City of Sails"; Waitemata on the Pacific Ocean and Manukau by the Tasman Sea. And, Auckland lives upto its name having the highest number of boats per capita in the world. As you're never too far from water in Auckland you can take a relaxing harbor cruise, a fishing charter, whale and dolphin spotting, kayaking or surfing. Also take a walk through the Aukland Harbour Bridge to observe the country with a different view. Built in 1959 as a four-lane highway, heavy traffic took its charm away. However, a Japanese firm has brought it back to life with renovations which is why it is now jokingly referred to as the 'Nippon Clip-on' because of this extension.</p>
<p>When not in water, you can pay a visit to the prolific Auckland War Memorial Museum, stroll along the Auckland Harbour Bridge and the Sky Tower, the tallest tower in the Southern Hemisphere standing at an astounding 328 meters.
