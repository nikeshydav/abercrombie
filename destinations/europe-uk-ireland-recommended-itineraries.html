<h1>Pride and Prejudice Tour - In the Footsteps of Jane Austen</h1>
<div class="popupbanner"><img src="../images/Pride.jpg" alt="Pride and Prejudice Tour" /><img src="../images/banner-bottom-shadow.gif" alt="Banner" /></div>

<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong>  6 days </p>
<p>A special Pride and Prejudice themed tour leading you into the world of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr Darcy, whose story has captured the
imaginations of so many.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong> Chawton House, Pride & Prejudice costume exhibition, village of Lacock used as the setting for Meryton, the Georgian city of Bath,
the real "Longbourn Court"</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>Arrive London</h5>
<p>After clearing customs at the airport, meet your Guardian Angel and transfer by private vehicle to your hotel. After check in, the remainder of
your day is at leisure to settle in to this historic city on the River Thames.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> The Milestone</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Chawton & Winchester</h5>
<p>
Embark on a full-day excursion to the south west of London. Firstly drive into the rural countryside of Hampshire where Jane Austen spent much
of her life, stopping in the village of Chawton. Visit the house where the author lived in the latter years of her life and where she penned the
majority of her mature writing (including Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility which were both revised in the house as well as Emma
and Persuasion which were entirely written here).
</p>
<p>If you are visiting between October and December 2013 you may like to visit the special exhibition "She Had Dressed With More Than Usual
Care" in which costumes worn in the 1995 BBC Production of Pride and Prejudice will be displayed..</p>
<p>Also of interest may be St. Nicholas Church where the Austens worshipped. You can enter the church and also see the graves where Jane’s
mother and sister are buried. Just a short walk away is the Chawton House Library; a beautiful building where the landscaping around the house
has been re-planted to reflect what it looked like in Austen's day.</p>
<p>Afterwards head to Winchester where Jane Austen was buried in the cathedral in 1817 at the age of 41. Winchester Cathedral was a building she
greatly admired and her modest funeral was attended by just four people. There is an illustrated exhibition detailing Jane Austen’s life, work and
death in Hampshire displayed beside her grave. Jane Austen only lived a few weeks in the house (now a private residence) in College Street but
continued to write there.</p>
<p><strong>Optional Excursion:</strong> Travel north onto Salisbury Plain to visit Stonehenge, arguably the most famous prehistoric site in Europe. Visitors cannot
fail to wonder at the effort it must have taken to drag the enormous stones over the land and erect them in circles. From here return to London
past Old Sarum hill.</p>

<strong>Overnight:</strong> The Milestone<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>Basildon Park - Lacock - Bath</h5>
<p>
On your way to Bath today, stop at Basildon Park near the town of Reading. This impressive Georgian House took a starring role in the 2005
production of Pride & Prejudice, starring Keira Knightley as Lizzy. The mansion played Mr Bingley's house, Netherfield, a suitably grand
residence for a 'young man of four or five thousand a year'.</p>
<p>Continue your journey west and visit Lacock; a timeless, traditional English village. Besides being used as a movie set for Harry Potter and the
Philosopher's Stone, Lacock appeared as Meryton in the 1995 BBC television adaptation of Pride & Prejudice. Here the Bennet girls shopped for
bonnets, sought the latest gossip from their Aunt Phillips, and hoped to attract the attentions of the officers.</p>

<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> The Royal Crescent<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>Bath</h5>
<p>
Explore the city of Bath which is so familiar throughout Jane Austen’s novels as a prosperous spa resort, popular with fashionable society. The
city’s impeccably preserved Georgian architecture remains unchanged from the streets described in Northanger Abbey and Persuasion.
</p>
<p>Visit the magnificent Assembly Rooms and admire the Ball Room, Octagon, Tea Room and Card Room that were used in the eighteenth

<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>GOLF AT GLENEAGLES</h5>
<p> This morning, enjoy an early morning tee time to play a round on the 6,471 yard King's Course. James Braid's plan for the King's Course was to test even the best players' shot-making skills over the eighteen holes making it both challenging and exhilarating for any golfer. Gleneagles is certainly one of the most beautiful places to play golf in the world, with the springy moorland turf underfoot, the un-spoilt views from the tees, the rock-faced mountains to the north, the green hills to the south, and the peaks of the Trossachs and Ben Vorlich on the western horizon.</p>

This is a world of wide grassland plains, acacia copses, pools and streams. All the 'Big Five' are here - elephant, buffalo, lion, leopard and even rhino can still be found.

Serengeti is the home of the great wildebeest migration and the short grass plains around your accommodation provide the perfect setting for the wildebeest as they mass around the area during the birthing of their young in the early months of each year.<br /><br />Kusini is perfectly located in a private corner of the Serengeti and sited among a cluster of kopjes (beautiful outcrops of granite rock).&nbsp; Part of Kusini's charm is its remote and private location within the park borders and with no other camps in the near vicinity Kusini offers exceptional and essentially private game viewing.<br /></p>";

A wide range of activities are offered at Olonana and you can plan your day to be as active or as leisurely as you wish. Visit the adjacent Maasai village, take a morning bush walk with an armed ranger or enjoy sundowners in the evening or even dinner under the stars in the middle of the African bush.<br /><br />In the Mara, the wildlife is abundant and the swaying grasslands ensure that animals are never out of sight. Elephants browse amongst the large herds of wildebeest, topi, gazelle, eland and buffalo. The plains offer a rich variety of food for the dominant predators: lion, leopard, hyena and cheetah. In the Mara River, hippos submerge while crocodiles sunbathe on the riverbanks.<br /><br />Around July to September, rain depending, the Masai Mara is host to the famous wildebeest migration which is one of the few remaining mass migrations of mammals in the world. During this time herds of over a million wildebeest will trawl their way through this region and they become the major focus for predatory activity and drama unfolds at every corner.<br /><br />There are also options for a morning balloon safari or a half-day visit to Lake Victoria.<br /><br />Balloon Safari: As the balloon is inflated against the first rays of sunrise your pilot will go through safety procedures. Once aloft, the balloon floats gently over the plains, giving a bird's eye view of the game below as the sun creeps slowly over the horizon. After around one hour the balloon lands as breakfast is already being prepared and, of course, enjoy a glass or two of bubbly to toast your flight in a tradition initiated by the Montgolfier brothers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lake Victoria Adventure : An early start this morning with a transfer to the airstrip for a flight by light aircraft to Lake Victoria. On arrival enjoy an appetising full English breakfast before you board the boat for the morning. There will be the opportunity to try fishing for the legendary giant Nile perch found in these waters as you explore the myriad of tiny islands in this region of the lake. An experienced and knowledgeable fisherman captains each boat. There is the chance to stop at a traditional fishing village and see how the villagers live from day to day before returning to the airstrip for your return flight to the Masai Mara.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p>";
