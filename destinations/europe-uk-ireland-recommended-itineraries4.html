<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong>  9 days </p>
<p>In celebration of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee, this itinerary is ideal for travellers interested in the English Monarchy and Britain's Royal heritage.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong> Westminster Abbey, Houses of Parliament, Tower of London, St. Paul's Cathedral, Kensington Palace, Windsor Castle, Eton College, Edinburgh Castle, Holyrood Palace, Royal Yacht Britannia, Scone Palace, Stirling Castle, Linlithgow Palace</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>Arrive Heathrow</h5>
<p>Upon arrival at the London Heathrow airport, you will be met by your Guardian Angel and transferred by private vehicle to your hotel in London, where you will be assisted with check-in.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> The Goring Hotel </p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Royal Westminster</h5>
<p>Today you will be met by a London Guide who will take you on a tour of the City of Westminster where you will see the sites associated with the Royal Family. Start in Parliament Square where you will visit Westminster Abbey, the National Church of England and scene for many state occasions including the Queen's Coronation in 1953 following her accession to the throne in February 1952, and the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2011.</p>
<p>From here you will continue past the iconic Houses of Parliament and Downing Street into Whitehall. This street was once the site of Whitehall Palace built by King Henry VIII. Subject to availability, you will visit the only part of the palace to survive, the Banqueting House, built by Inigo Jones and decorated by Peter Paul Rubens.</p>
<p>At the top of Whitehall is Trafalgar Square where you turn into the Mall, the royal route that leads to Buckingham Palace. On the north side of the Mall is Clarence House, the official London residence of the Prince of Wales.
</p>
<p>Buckingham Palace, the Queen's official residence in London, is one of the most iconic sites in the world. In August and September you will be able to take a tour of the opulent state apartments where many functions are held each year. At other times, you may visit the Queen's Gallery where important items from the Royal Collection are on display, and the Royal Mews where the ceremonial carriages are maintained.</p>
<p>In August and September this year you will be able to visit a collection of the Queen's best diamonds on display at the palace.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong>The Goring Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B </p>

<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>The City of London</h5>
<p>
Your guide and chauffeur will be waiting to meet you for a further full day sightseeing tour. Today you will visit the Tower of London, the ancient royal fortress guarding the City of London. Here the Yeoman Warders - the 'Beefeaters' - guard the dazzling Crown Jewels that are still used for royal ceremonies to this day. Visit the White Tower, the central and oldest block of the complex; then see the reconstruction of the Medieval Palace that aims to show the style in which the medieval kings of England would have lived when they had apartments at the Tower.  </p>
<p>
You will also visit St. Paul's Cathedral, the baroque masterpiece that was rebuilt by Sir Christopher Wren after the Great Fire of London in 1666. It has also been used for state occasions, most notably the wedding of the Prince of Wales to Lady Diana Spencer in 1981.</p>
<p>
This afternoon, you may visit Kensington Palace, where you can take time to explore the state apartments of this ornate house that was a favorite royal home before Buckingham Palace was chosen to be the official residence. It was also here where Diana, as Princess of Wales lived her last years. After your tour of the palace, take a walk across Kensington Gardens to visit the fountain that was created in her memory.</p>
<p>

It is very close to Highgrove House, the home of the Prince of Wales and where Princes William and Harry spent time during their childhood. Visit the Highgrove Shop, where a wide range of organic foods and other items promoted by the Prince of Wales are on sale.</p>
<p>

<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>Windsor and Eton - flight to Edinburgh</h5>
<p>This morning you will leave your London hotel with your driver-guide and head west out of London to Windsor, the town to the west of London that has long been associated with royalty. You will enjoy a tour of Windsor Castle, the largest inhabited castle in the world, and the Queen's favourite residence. Visit the State Apartments, including St. George's Hall that has been beautifully reconstructed following the fire of 1992. Here you will see Queen Mary's Doll's House, a stunning miniature house with beautiful furnishings and fittings. You will also see the beautiful St. George's Chapel, the home of the Order of the Garter and one of the royal sepulchres in England.</p>

<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>Royal Edinburgh</h5>
<p>This morning, you will meet an expert local guide for a full day sightseeing tour of Scotland's capital city, on which you will see the landmarks that are associated with the city's royal heritage. You will first head up to Edinburgh Castle, where you will see the 'Honours of Scotland', or the Scottish Crown Jewels, and obtain stunning views of the city. You will then continue down the Royal Mile to St. Giles Cathedral, home to the Order of the Thistle of which the Queen is the head. The lower end of the Royal Mile is called the Canongate; here you will see the royal church in Edinburgh, the venue of the wedding of Zara Phillips, the Queen's granddaughter. At the end of the Royal Mile, and opposite the magnificent Scottish Parliament building, is Holyrood Palace, the Queen's Official Residence in Scotland. (You will tour the staterooms of the palace if no member of the Royal Family is staying here at the time).</p>
<p>
This afternoon, you will drive down to the city docks at Leith, where you will board the former Royal Yacht Britannia, now permanently moored here. Built in Scotland, this ship was used by the Royal Family for many official voyages during her working life. See the elegant staterooms where the Queen hosted dinners. You will see the intimate private quarters where the Royal Family relaxed, and also the 'behind the scenes' areas where the crew lived and worked.</p>

<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>Scone and St. Andrews</h5>
<p>Today you will have a full day excursion to the north of Edinburgh with your driver-guide. Cross the mighty Forth Bridge and head to Scone Palace, home of the Earls of Mansfield. In the grounds of the palace is Moot Hill, the ancient coronation place of the Scottish kings, who sat on the Stone of Destiny during the ceremony. This stone was taken to Westminster Abbey by the English King Edward I, but is now housed in Edinburgh Castle.</p>
<p>
You will then cross over the River Tay into the region known as Fife. On the far eastern side of Fife is the delightful town of St. Andrews that overlooks the North Sea. This town is known throughout the world as the home of golf, it was here that the first modern golf course developed. However St. Andrews was originally the ecclesiastical capital of Scotland, and you will visit the ruins of the cathedral, destroyed during the Reformation.</p>
<p>
The town is also the home of Scotland's oldest university, and it is here that Prince William and Kate Middleton met while they were both students at the university. Take time to explore the quadrangles that house the present university departments and facilities before returning to Edinburgh.</p>

<h4>Day 8</h4>
<h5>Stirling and Linlithgow</h5>
<p>Your final day of touring with your driver-guide will take you to the west of Edinburgh along the valley of the River Forth. Your destination is Stirling, the strategic site at a bridging point on the river where both William 'Braveheart' Wallace and Robert the Bruce defeated the English armies during the Scottish Wars of Independence. Stirling Castle developed as one of the most important royal fortresses in Scotland; it boasts a fine Great Hall, and a Chapel Royal where Mary Queen of Scots was crowned when just an infant.</p>
<p>
On your return back to Edinburgh you will visit the ruins of Linlithgow Palace. With a delightful setting on the banks of a lake, and a convenient location between Edinburgh and Stirling, this was one of the favourite residences of the Stuart Kings of Scotland. It was here that Mary Queen of Scots was born in 1542; although it is now a ruin, the stout remains indicate how majestically the medieval monarchs of Scotland lived.</p>

Enjoy a picnic lunch amongst the hippos and birds before visiting a Maasai village this afternoon.<br /><br />The floor of the crater is only 100 square miles but is home to around 30,000 animals with a high concentration of predators and some of the finest black-maned lions in Africa. Rhinos can be seen with calves at heel. Eland and waterbuck appear not to notice the human visitors, enabling photographers to shoot at ease. On the lake in the middle of the crater you may see thousands of flamingos, fluttering and shimmering like a pink heat haze. Zebra and wildebeest account for almost half the animals - gazelle, buffalo, eland, hartebeest and wart hog can also be seen.<br /></p>";

Visit the adjacent Maasai village, take a morning bush walk with an armed ranger or enjoy sundowners in the evening or even dinner under the stars in the middle of the African bush.<br /><br />In the Mara, the wildlife is abundant and the swaying grasslands ensure that animals are never out of sight. Elephants browse amongst the large herds of wildebeest, topi, gazelle, eland and buffalo. The plains offer a rich variety of food for the dominant predators: lion, leopard, hyena and cheetah. In the Mara River, hippos submerge while crocodiles sunbathe on the riverbanks.<br /><br />Around July to September, rain depending, the Masai Mara is host to the famous wildebeest migration which is one of the few remaining mass migrations of mammals in the world. During this time herds of over a million wildebeest will trawl their way through this region and they become the major focus for predatory activity and drama unfolds at every corner.<br /><br />There are also options for a morning balloon safari or a half-day visit to Lake Victoria.<br /><br />Balloon Safari: As the balloon is inflated against the first rays of sunrise your pilot will go through safety procedures. Once aloft, the balloon floats gently over the plains, giving a bird's eye view of the game below as the sun creeps slowly over the horizon. After around one hour the balloon lands as breakfast is already being prepared and, of course, enjoy a glass or two of bubbly to toast your flight in a tradition initiated by the Montgolfier brothers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lake Victoria Adventure : An early start this morning with a transfer to the airstrip for a flight by light aircraft to Lake Victoria. On arrival enjoy an appetising full English breakfast before you board the boat for the morning. There will be the opportunity to try fishing for the legendary giant Nile perch found in these waters as you explore the myriad of tiny islands in this region of the lake. An experienced and knowledgeable fisherman captains each boat. There is the chance to stop at a traditional fishing village and see how the villagers live from day to day before returning to the airstrip for your return flight to the Masai Mara.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p>";
