<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 7 Nights</p>
<p> The land of the Kasbah's, busy ports, nomadic Berbers, high mountains and expansive desert offers a romantic escape from the world as you know it. Visit ancient mosques and walk hand in hand through lively city squares, follow mountain slopes and feel the breeze coming from picturesque lakes. Then share your nights in amazing kasbahs, palace hotels and intimate desert tents that all reflect the ambience of a bygone era.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>India/Casablanca, Morocco</h5>
<p>You are met on arrival and given VIP assistance in clearing customs formalities and collecting your luggage; then travel by private vehicle to your unique vintage townhouse hotel, located in the heart of the city. Originally settled by Berbers in the seventh century, Casablanca today is a bustling, French-influenced center. This afternoon, join your guide for a tour of this port city, stopping at the formidable Hassan II Grand Mosque. Its minaret is the tallest religious structure in the world, and part of the mosque's floor is glass, enabling worshippers to kneel directly over the sea. Enjoy dinner at Rick's Café, housed in a 1930's mansion and based on the café everybody came to in the famous film Casablanca.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Le Doge <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,D
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Casablanca/Er-Rachida/Merzouga</h5>
<p>Meet your private A&K guide, an affable local resident and an expert on Morocco's culture and traditions, who accompanies you throughout your journey in Morocco. Board a charter flight to Er-Rachidia, and on arrival have lunch in Erfoud. Hop into a four-wheel-drive vehicle for a drive across the stunning Erg Chebbi Dunes to your exclusive A&K Desert Tented Camp in a remote area of the Sahara Desert. You are welcomed with mint tea and pastries and led to your private Moroccan caidal-styled tent that combines elements of Berber and Bedouin styles. Decorated with colorful carpets, it comfortably sleeps two, and has its own private bathroom with a shower and toilet next door. Set off on camelback in the evening and begin exploring the sand dunes. Return to your nomadic accommodations before sitting down to a Bedouin dinner served around the campfire.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Desert Tented Camp <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5> Merzouga/Erfoud/Skoura</h5>
<p>The drive today takes you across the southern slopes of the High Atlas range and through the Dades Valley. Along the way, stop at some of the many date palmeries and a small, private museum that houses exhibits showcasing local art, culture and history. Travel the "Road of a Thousand Kasbahs" and view the amazing 17th-century Amerhidl Kasbah; its façade appears on the Moroccan 50-dirham note. After lunch, continue to your home for the next two nights - a luxurious 19th-century Kasbah that was part of a sultan's private hunting ground in the Skoura Oasis. Dar Ahlam means "house of dreams," and the name suits it well. Enter what seems like a dreamscape, where colorful veils, lanterns and candles - and only 12 rooms - ensure complete privacy, setting the mood for romance. Sit by the fireplace, surrounded by a kaleidoscope of colors; have lunch in the garden or olive grove; or dine in a secluded corner of the Kasbah or even on a hidden terrace.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Dar Ahlam<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>Skoura</h5>
<p>Not far from the desert oasis of Skoura is Ouarzazate Lake, where you take a walk and then sit down to a delightful picnic lunch on its shores. If you look across the lake you can see the mountains and desert; on a windy day, the waters toss and swell like the ocean. Afterward, return to your Kasbah for a refreshing swim and maybe a massage. This evening, savor a romantic dinner in an equally romantic setting: in the gardens under the almond trees, in the palm grove or on the riverbank.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Dar Ahlam<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5> Skoura/Ouarzazate/Ait Benhaddou/Marrakech</h5>
<p>Spend some time wandering around Ouarzazate, a city originally built as a French garrison in the 1920s and now known for its pottery and carpets. Afterward, visit the Glaoui Kasbah of Taourit. One of Morocco's most beautiful Kasbahs, it consists of a network of luxury apartments, simple clay houses and crenellated towers decorated with geometric motifs. Continue to the fortified village of Ait Benhaddou, where some of the world's most elaborate and decorative kasbahs are found. See how they seem to defy the laws of gravity as they perch upon the sleep slope. Ait Benhaddou's charms have also reached all the way to Hollywood. Many popular movies, including Lawrence of Arabia, Jesus of Nazareth, Gladiator and The Mummy have been filmed here. After lunch in a local restaurant, continue to exotic Marrakech, the "Pearl of the South," and your Moorish-style palace hotel.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Ksar Char Bagh <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>Marrakech</h5>
<p>Morocco's most famous city, Marrakech is veiled in mystery and magic. Visit the medina, the old walled section of the city, where most of the architectural attractions are located. Begin with a stop at Koutoubia Mosque and its 12th-century minaret, which dominates the local skyline. Make your way to vibrant Djemaa el-Fna, Marrakech's main square. Watch as fire-eaters, mime artists, snake charmers and street musicians perform at every turn. Continue walking and look for the Saadian Tombs, decorated in Granada-style carving and hidden away behind high walls. Discover how the privileged lived in the 19th century when you wander Bahia Palace to see the beautiful mosaics, fountains and courtyards. At the Museum of Moroccan Arts and Crafts, housed in the beautiful Dar Si Said palace, view stunning traditional woven carpets and Berber silver jewelry. Afterward, return to your hotel to experience a very important part of Moroccan culture and life: a hammam (steam bath). More than a steam bath, the hammam is a ritual. Soak in hot, soft water, lather up with a special penetrating black soap and exfoliate for revived skin. Follow up with a cold shower and an incredibly relaxing massage in a warm, darkened room - total bliss.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Ksar Char Bagh <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> Meals: B,L</p>
</li>

<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 7 days</p>
<p>This programme is designed to give a taste of Morocco - experience its culture, architecture and ancient monuments by exploring two of the major historical cities, Fes and Marrakech, in great detail.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong> Casablanca, Fes, Meknes, Volubilis, Marrakech.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>ARRIVE CASABLANCA/FES</h5>
<p>
Upon arrival in Casablanca, your guide will meet you and you will be driven to the Hassan II mosque in Casablanca before heading to Fes. Upon arrival you will be transferred to your hotel and the rest of the afternoon will be at leisure. </p>
   <p>
Fes is the oldest of the four imperial cities in Morocco. It dominated the country's religious, cultural and political life for thousands of years and was a protectorate of the French, who moved the capital to Rabat.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Riad Fes<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>FES</h5>
<p>
After breakfast, embark on a walking tour of the medieval medina with your private guide. Within the medina you will visit museums, busy souks, old schools and fondouks (old hotels for traders). Be sure to take in the ancient and astonishing architecture.</p>
<p>
After lunch, continue your exploration of Fes as you visit Riad Al Kantara. See how this beautiful place is being restored and learn from a master how to carve plaster and produce zellige (Moroccan ceramics). You will also have the opportunity to learn to prepare some traditional Moroccan bread.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Riad Fes<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>FES - MEKNES - VOLUBILIS - FES</h5>
<p>
After breakfast, meet your guide and travel by private vehicle to Meknes, another imperial city of Morocco. Visit the impressive monuments, royal stables and Moulay Ismail's Mausoleum.</p>
<p>
After lunch head to Volubilis, the site of the largest and most well preserved Roman ruins in Morocco. However, the greatest treasures of Volubilis are the superb mosaic floors which have been excellently preserved.</p>
<p>After sightseeing head back to Fes.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Riad Fes<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>FES - MARRAKECH</h5>
<p>
This morning, you are transferred to Fes Airport to board your chartered plane to Marrakech.</p>
<p>
Marrakech is the city of the south, also known as "the red city" due to the colours of the buildings. Founded by the Almoravid Berbers of the Western Sahara in 1062, Marrakech is one of the world's great cities, a place of legend and popularity that still manages to remain charged with mystery. The surrounding countryside, the flat plains, the High Atlas Mountains, all provide an unforgettable backdrop to one of the most sophisticated cities in Africa.</p>
<p>
On arrival at Marrakech Airport, you are met and privately transferred to Amanjena.</p>
<p>
This afternoon is spent sightseeing via horse-drawn carriages, visiting the beautiful Menara and Marjorelle gardens.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Amanjena<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>MARRAKECH</h5>
<p>
This morning, accompanied by your guide, set out to continue discovering the secrets of Marrakech.</p>
<p>
Pay a visit to the Ben Youssef Medersa (Koranic School) and the Ooubba Almoravides, the ablution centre for believers going to the mosque. With your expert guide take a walk through the old medina and labyrinthine souks, a maze of colourful alleys and small squares which are home to a bewildering number of stalls and ateliers devoted to specific crafts. Emerging from this maze, you find yourself in the famous Djemaa el Fna, the city's main square. No one is really certain how it came into being, but over the years the square has become the beating heart of Marrakech, where fire eaters, mime artists, snake charmers and street musicians perform at every turn.</p>
<p>
Right in front of the square you will find the Koutubia Mosque which is an emblem of Marrakech. Built in the 12th century, the Koutoubia minaret is the most perfect Islamic religious structure in North Africa. Koutoubia's minaret went on to inspire the architects of the Giralda of Seville and the Hassan Tower of Rabat. This famous landmark dominates the local skyline and can easily be spotted from anywhere in Marrakech. The tour ends at the El-Badi and Bahia Palaces.</p>
<p>
There is the option to visit and donate to a local community foundation that we support.</p>
<p>
There will be a guest speaker at dinner.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Amanjena<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>MARRAKECH</h5>
<p>
After breakfast, depart in a 4x4 for a rocky desert located approximately one hour from Marrakech.</p>
<p>
Visit a private stable which breeds Arab horses and, should you be so inclined, enjoy a brief ride on one of these remarkable creatures.</p>
<p>
Once in the desert, enjoy a short mountain bike ride before getting on horses to ride through the desert like true Berbers (non riders can follow in a 4x4) to your camp where you will be served lunch.</p>
<p>
Next there will be a demonstration of eagle and falcon flights. Possibly even try it yourself (depending on the mood of the animals), before seeing a Fantasia Show.</p>
<p>
Return back to your hotel and relax. Perhaps enjoy a hammam in the luxurious Amanjena spa.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overnight:</strong> Amanjena<br />

The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, when 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other game that follow close behind make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";

During this time herds of over a million wildebeest will trawl their way through this region and they become the major focus for predatory activity and drama unfolds at every corner.<br /><br />There are also options for a morning balloon safari or a half-day visit to Lake Victoria.<br /><br />Balloon Safari: As the balloon is inflated against the first rays of sunrise your pilot will go through safety procedures. Once aloft, the balloon floats gently over the plains, giving a bird's eye view of the game below as the sun creeps slowly over the horizon. After around one hour the balloon lands as breakfast is already being prepared and, of course, enjoy a glass or two of bubbly to toast your flight in a tradition initiated by the Montgolfier brothers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lake Victoria Adventure : An early start this morning with a transfer to the airstrip for a flight by light aircraft to Lake Victoria. On arrival enjoy an appetising full English breakfast before you board the boat for the morning. There will be the opportunity to try fishing for the legendary giant Nile perch found in these waters as you explore the myriad of tiny islands in this region of the lake.

Marrakech is the main city of the south, also known as "the red city" due to the colours of the buildings. Founded by the Almoravid Berbers of the Western Sahara in 1062, it is one of the world's great cities, a place of legend and popularity that still manages to remain charged with mystery. The surrounding countryside, the flat plains, the High Atlas Mountains, they all provide an unforgettable backdrop to one of the most sophisticated cities in Africa.</p>

<p>
Visit the Bahia Palace, a small piece of folly ordered in 1880 by the great vizier Sidi Moussa. A remarkable example of Moroccan architecture in the 19th century, it took 15 years to complete and gives a good idea of how the privileged lived during this time. Continue on to the Dar Si Said Museum, a smaller version of the Bahia Palace.</p>
<p>
Your day is not complete without ending up at the Djemâa el Fna square, with stalls of dried fruit or orange juice freshly pressed before you, and the multitude of small restaurants that take over its centre from early evening. No one really knows how it came into being, but over the years it has become the beating heart of Marrakech, where fire eaters, mime artists, snake charmers and street musicians perform at every turn.</p>
