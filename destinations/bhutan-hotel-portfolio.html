Elegant, expansive and luxuriously appointed, the rooms, in the manner of all Taj Hotels, pamper guests with the finest amenities. Suites, on the other hand, feature distinctive canopy beds, walk-in closets and home theatre systems. Natural lighting emphasizes large, well laid-out bathrooms featuring standalone Christina bathtubs.</p>

<dt><h2>UMA PARO</h2> 
<p>Uma Paro offers exceptional style in the Himalayan Kingdom of Bhutan. Reflecting an understated philosophy of
quiet comfort in a unique, culture-rich location, this inland retreat is also dedicated to activity and adventure amongst 
dramatic pine-clad valleys and snow-tipped ranges.</p>
<div class="thepet">
<p>The main building, formerly a Bhutanese nobleman's home, forms the hotel's heart, whilst the rooms and suites are 
located in glades planted with azaleas. Materials include handcrafted stone, wood and tiles whilst Bhutan's vernacular
imprint is felt in timber darkened by smoke from wood fires, and white walls vividly painted by local artists. Villas all
have a 'bukhari' stove.</p>
