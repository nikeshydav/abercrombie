<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Norway Arctic Cruise (Polar Bears & Midnight Sun)</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> July 29 ? August 09, 2014 <br /> On board MV LE BOREAL 
(program dates/ cruise dates embark Tromso July 30 and disembark Longyearbyen on August 8)
</p>
<p><strong>Overview: </strong>Step aboard the MV Le Boreal and join Abercrombie & Kent on a cruise to this remote, rarely visited but one of the most exceptional destinations on earth. Polar bears, Walrus, arctic fox and reindeer as well as an amazingly diverse assortment of birds are as plentiful as cathedrals of ice, glaciers and craggy mountain peaks in the Svalbard archipelago. Surprisingly, an astounding quantity of flora surrounds this barren landscape, which comes alive with color under the late summer?s midnight sun. The High Arctic is a naturalist?s paradise. <br /><br />
Your A&K Expedition team will bestow you with an enlightening experience like no other from the Northern Shores of Norway to the islands of the High Arctic Svalbard archipelago, traversing the ice-edge at nearly 82 degrees north (and less than 600 miles from the geographic North Pole) where the land and ice-scape is ruled by one resident, the evasive polar bear.

<h5>Oslo/ Tromso, Norway</h5>
<p>This morning following breakfast, you will transfer to the airport and check in for charter flight to The Northern Coastal city of Troms? which is located 217 miles north of the Arctic Circle.<br /><br />

Troms? was developed in the late 18th century when its harbor, noted for being ice-free year round due to the Gulf Stream, was a major center for fishing and trade. The town is situated on an island linked to the mainland by the striking Troms? Bridge.  Upon arrival you will have a city tour that will include the Domkirke cathedral and the statue of polar Explorer Roald Amundsen, then to the southern tip of the island to visit the Troms? museum with it?s fascinating displays of both ancient and modern life of the Sami, as well as archeology and geology of northern Norway.  Enjoy lunch at a local restaurant then visit the stunning Arctic Cathedral.  <br /><br />

This afternoon, board the MV Le Boreal to embark on your Arctic adventure.  <br />

<h5> Barents Sea Norway</h5>
<p>Today, Le Boreal heads north through the Barents Sea. This morning enjoy breakfast and spend time on deck with your expedition naturalists as you keep an eye out for whales and the many sea-birds common in these waters.<br /><br />

This afternoon, Le Boreal reaches Bj?rn?ya (Bear Island) which is the southernmost island in the Svalbard Archipelego.  We plan to board Zodiacs to cruise along the southern tip of the island and its massive bird cliffs, home to kittiwakes, guillemots and the occasional puffin.   Later, we plan to land at the islands Northern tip to view puffin colonies and visit the meteorological station based there.<br /><br />

<h5>Svalbard Island</h5>
<p>The Le Boreal serves as your maritime passport to adventure in this remote Arctic Archipelago that very few people in the world will ever have the opportunity to view.  We will have 7 full days of expedition cruising as we circumnavigate Spitsbergen Island.  The Captain and Expedition team are on the lookout for the day?s best expeditionary options.  Visits may include:<br /><br />

<strong>Hornsund </strong> is a stunning fjord is on the Southwest corner of Spitsbergen with rugged rock walls surmounting blue hued glaciers criss-crossed by crevasses, with birds perching in the high cliffs.  The ?glacier coast? to the south provides magnificent views of slow moving glaciers that travel toward the sea.  Here we often will see Beluga whales feeding at the front of the glacier as well as ringed seals.<br /><br />

<strong>Halvmaneoya </strong> also referred to as ?half moon island? and was used as a hunting ground for over-wintering Russians and Norwegians in the late 17th century.  Polar Bears and arctic foxes were hunted for their meat and fur, and walrus for their blubber.  Today, the island is a haven for birds including eider ducks, arctic terns, snow bunting and grey phalaropes. We also visit an old hunting hut ?Bjorneborg? (the bear castle) which was used by hunters and trappers.<br /><br />

<strong>Barents?ya and Edge?ya: </strong> These islands in Southern Svalbard off the southern tip of Spitsbergen provide excellent opportunities for Tundra hikes to enjoy the scenic beauty that is Svalbard.  The colors of the tundra are alive with blooming flowers, varied bird and duck species and grazing reindeer.<br /><br />

<strong> Torrelnesset </strong> is located in far southwest coast of the island of Nordaustlandet which is the highest arctic land mass in the Svalbard archipelago and predominantly ice-covered.  We go ashore at the barren coast to view the walrus colonies that are common here.<br /><br />

<strong>Hinlopen Strait: </strong> Le Boreal will navigate this passageway between the Main island of Spitsbergen and the island of Nordaustlandet. Here we will visit alkefejellet or ?auk cliffs? which are sheer and stunning cliffs that drop directly into the sea and are home to colonies of auks.<br /><br />

<strong>Woodfjorden and Leifdefjorden </strong> are known for their unique and intriguing geological distinctions.   Jagged peaks and dormant volcano?s surround red sand-stone hills and still active geothermal springs.  These geological features create an ideal habitat for birds and other wildlife including Polar Bears, fox and reindeer. <br /><br />

<strong>Magdalenefjordenis </strong>located on Spitsbergen?s Northwest corner and one of the most scenic and iconic fjords in all of Svalbard.<br /><br />

<strong>NyAlesund </strong>has a history stretching back to the early Arctic explorers.  Today, a polar research station occupies the site where a Norwegian coal mind once operated.  Here Scientists study meteorology, seismology, atmospheric sciences and marine biology.  Conditions permitting, you go ashore to visit the small community, including the northernmost post office in the world and the small museum and art gallery. <br /><br />

Throughout our landings and days of cruising in Spitsbergen, our primarily objective will be to view the Polar Bears and other wildlife that reside in this remote Arctic wilderness.  Each landing is under the close supervision of our Bear Guardians, and our time at sea will be primarily in search of ice, which is where we have the optimal chance to find the Ice Bears in their natural habitat. <br /><br />

<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p>
<strong>Norway, Greenland and Iceland</strong><br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> August 7 - August 21, 2014 <br />On board MV LE BOREAL (program dates/ cruise dates embark Longyearbyen Aug 8 and disembark Reykjavik August 21).</p>

<p>
Polar bears, Walrus, musk oxen as well as an exceedingly rich selection of birds are as abundant as cathedrals of ice, glaciers and craggy mountain peaks in the Svalbard archipelago, making the High Arctic a naturalist?s paradise. Out of the blue, a startling magnitude of flora environs this barren landscape which comes alive with color under the July midnight sun.  In Greenland, Ice and wildlife are accompanied by mysterious Bronze age villages, Eskimo settlements and native fishing villages, and the stark contrast of Iceland?s rustic tranquility where long-haired sheep graze luxuriant grasslands, yet under its surface simmer sparks of Europe?s most thermally active region. <br /><br />
Join Abercrombie & Kent on a voyage aboard the MV Le Boreal to this secluded, rarely visited but exceptional destination on earth. Unite with your A&K Expedition team on an enriching experience like no other, to the islands of the High Arctic Svalbard archipelago, traveling the ice-edge at nearly 82 degrees north (and less than 600 miles from the geographic North Pole) where the land and ice-scape is ruled by one resident, the elusive polar bear. Witness the seldom visited East Greenland coast and remote villages of Scoresby Sound and conclude in scenic fjords and coves of Western Iceland.

<h4>Saturday- Tuesday, August 09-12, 2014</h4>
<h5>Swalbard Islands </h5>
<p>The Le Boreal serves as your maritime passport to adventure in these remote Arctic Islands that very few people in the world will ever have the opportunity to view.  The Captain and Expedition team are on the lookout for the day?s best expeditionary options.  Visits may include:<br /><br />

<strong> Magdalenefjoren </strong> is a stunning fjord with rugged rock walls surmounting blue hued glaciers criss-crossed by crevasses, with birds perching in the high cliffs. The ?glacier coast? to the south provides magnificent views of slow moving glaciers that travel toward the sea.  We also hope to see colony of Walrus which frequent these beaches.<br /><br />

<strong> NyAlesund  </strong>has a history stretching back to the early Arctic explorers.  Today, a polar research station occupies the site where a Norwegian coal mind once operated.  Here Scientists study meteorology, seismology, atmospheric sciences and marine biology.

Enjoy a picnic lunch amongst the hippos and birds before visiting a Maasai village this afternoon.<br /><br />The floor of the crater is only 100 square miles but is home to around 30,000 animals with a high concentration of predators and some of the finest black-maned lions in Africa. Rhinos can be seen with calves at heel. Eland and waterbuck appear not to notice the human visitors, enabling photographers to shoot at ease. On the lake in the middle of the crater you may see thousands of flamingos, fluttering and shimmering like a pink heat haze. Zebra and wildebeest account for almost half the animals - gazelle, buffalo, eland, hartebeest and wart hog can also be seen.<br /></p>";

The Serengeti perhaps defines the safari experience as surely as the wildlife that inhabits it. Established in 1951, and covering an area of almost 15,000 square kilometers, an area comparable to the state of Connecticut or Northern Ireland, the Serengeti hosts a fantastically diverse ecosystem. The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, when 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other game that follow close behind make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";
