<dt><h2>Quito</h2> 
<p>Quito was founded in the 16th century on the ruins of an ancient Inca city. Today, the historical centre of the city preserves the true essence of South America's traditions and culture along with its colonial influences which has earned it the status of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. </p>
<div class="thepet"><p>Quito is snuggled up in the highlands of Ecuador at an elevation of 9,350 feet above sea level making it one of the highest capital cities of the world. The Valley of Guayllabamba River where Quito lies is flanked by volcanoes, such as Cotopaxi, Sincholagua, Antisana, and Cayambe.</p>
<p>Despite having suffered repeatedly from massive earthquakes in the past, Quito still conserves its architecture and arts in form of the monasteries of San Francisco and Santo Domingo, and the Church and Jesuit College of La Compañía, which is adorned with seven tones of gold and frescos that have led to its nickname of Quito's Sistine Chapel.

<dt><h2>The Galapagos Islands</h2> 
<p><strong>Ecuador Sightseeing</strong> is incomplete without a visit to the lost world that is Galapagos Islands. While cruising through Galapagos Islands, you truly come close to nature, and as your mind reels with enchantment leaving you slack-jawed in awe of the extraordinary delights of undiscovered life in its authentic element. </p>

</p>
<div class="thepet"><p>The Islands were discovered in 1835 when a Spanish exploratory vessel drifted off its course and ended up at its shores. This South American Island group has an iconic historical significance as it inspired naturalist Charles Darwin to write his prolific 'Theory of Evolution' after his participation in the 'Voyage of the Beagle". Moreover, each of the thirteen islands that form the whole island group boasts of a distinctive eco-system that offers a perfect setting for the development of countless species of animals and plants such as penguin, land and marine iguanas, Galapagos tortoise or blue footed boobies.</p>
<p>With Abercrombie & Kent's bespoke expedition itineraries in Galapagos Islands you can choose from an array of deluxe cruisers such as Galapagos Eclipse, Eric, Letty and Flamingo being few of the mention worthy ones which offer the classical luxuries along with premium comfort.</p>

<dt><h2>Otavalo</h2> 
<p>Otavalo lies in Imbabura Province about two hours north of Quito. This charming town leaves one with the colorful and effervescent impressions with its indigenous markets, artisan's crafts, and haciendas. Visit Plaza de los Poncho, a central market where visitors can buy handmade blankets, tablecloths, tagua nut jewelry, musical instruments, indigenous costumes, hand-painted platters and trays, purses, , spices, raw foods and much more.</p>
<div class="thepet"><p> Surrounding towns and villages such as Ibarra and Cotacachi are also worth stopping by for the quality of the leather goods production. One can also pause and devour the scenic beauty of the Andean highlands that follows throughout the Imbabura Province. Or also admire the splendid Cuicocho, or Lake of the Gods, which once used to be the crater of Cotacachi volcano.

<dt><h2>The Avenue of the Volcanoes</h2> 
<p>The Avenue of Volcanoes is one of the natural marvels of Ecuador, with some of the grandest (and most active) volcanoes in the world. Just south of Quito lies this majestic complex of several mountain peaks which includes the country's highest, and no less than nine awe-inspiring volcanoes.</p>
<div class="thepet"><p>The Avenue of the Volcanoes runs between the two different mountain chains; the Eastern and Western Cordillera and houses a number of local indigenous villages such as Cuenca throughout thriving with their own culture. As you drive through the Avenue of Volcanoes, you witness celebrated volcanoes bejeweling the entire valley along with Inca ruins of Ingapirca. Chimbozaro, the highest peak in Ecuador is also the closest to the Sun on earth due to its proximity to the Equator. Then towering over Quito city, is Cotopaxi one of the highest active volcanoes in the world. The scenic route through the Avenue of the Volcanoes is an incredible road to discovery of one of the most astonishing landscapes on the planet.</p>

This charming ancient city still boasts of its colonial heritage with Old and New Cathedrals imposing in the centre, along with the Flowers Park, the City Museum and the Modern Art Museum.</p>
<div class="thepet"><p>One of the best ways to experience Cuenca is with a leisurely stroll around the city and explore its historical sites, local markets where you can find the original 'Panama Hats', roadside cafes and restaurants while taking in the local culture.

<dt><h2>Guayaquil</h2> 
<p>Guayaquil is among the most important <strong>places to see in Ecuador</strong>. It is the second largest city and located on the banks of Guayas River. Its favorable location also gives a convenient access to the famed Galapagos Islands.</p>
<div class="thepet"><p>One of the must dos here is to take a relaxed stroll along the famous Malecón 2000 which is lined with a myriad of shops, parks and cobbled alleys stretching upto 2.5 kms along the banks of Guayas River. Travellers may also want to head over to Las Peñas which the last remaining neighborhood showcasing colonial architecture after the unfortunate fire catastrophe of the early 20th century. Take a walk through the Parque Seminario feeding the land iguanas and enjoy a spectacle of city's waterfront and art galleries and museums.</p>

<dt><h2>The Amazon</h2> 
<p>The Ecuadorian Amazon is one of the most diverse ecosystems in the world, housing not only a complex community of plants and animals, but also indigenous people who have lived there for millennia. The dense rainforest basin exhibits a strikingly varying landscape; upland rainforest with steep, rugged ridges and cascading streams and lowland rainforest. </p>
<div class="thepet"><p>The region is also characterized by huge variety of flora and fauna with extraordinary distinctions in their habitats. One of the world's true biodiversity hotspots, the Ecuadorian Amazon supports 50% of the country's mammals and a staggering 5% of the world's plant and bird species. As impenetrable as these forests may seem, they are accessible by light aircrafts and further journeys are carried forward through river usually ending at jungle lodges. Among the assortment of Amazonian wildlife species, there are spectacled bear, howler monkeys, and jaguars as well as two species of fresh water dolphins to be discovered. Additionally there is a plethora of birds for the bird watchers too. Visitors also often come face to face with the indigenous Amazonian tribes such as Shuar, Cofani, Huarani and Secoya.</p>
