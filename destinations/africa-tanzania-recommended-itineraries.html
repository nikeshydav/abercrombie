<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p>Watch for the revered "Big Five," embark on an exciting scavenger hunt and enjoy a picnic lunch near the hippo pool at Ngorongoro Crater on this fun-filled Family adventure visiting three game parks.</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 8 Days</p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong> &bull; Enjoy the services of a Children's Activity Coordinator, who travels with the group and organizes activities for all age levels<br />
&bull; Embark on a family treasure hunt through a famous market in the Ngorongoro Highlands<br />
&bull; Visit with an elder at a Maasai village to learn about the traditional ways of these nomadic people<br />
&bull; Children participate in a special game drive during their stay in the Serengeti</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>

<h5>Arrive Arusha, Tanzania</h5>
<p>Arrive by overnight flight to Tanzania, where your unforgettable wildlife adventure unfolds. On your adventure, you can view animals up-close from inside an extinct volcano and meet a longstanding local tribe to learn about their traditions and culture.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Serena Mountain Village</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Arusha/Tarangire National Park</h5>
<p>Travel by road to Tarangire National Park, made up of eight distinct vegetation zones varying from swamps to open grasslands and acacia parkland. The variety of landscapes allows many animal and bird species to thrive. The park has an exceptional elephant population and the highest recorded number of breeding bird species for any habitat in the world. Settle in to your lodge, and then set out on an afternoon game drive. This evening, Abercrombie & Kent hosts a welcome dinner.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Tarangire Sopa Lodge<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B L D</p>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>Tarangire National Park</h5>
<p>Morning and afternoon game drives take you through the landscapes of Tarangire, which change from baobab tree forests and swamps to flat plains dotted with distinctive, thorny acacia trees. The most outstanding feature in the park is the Tarangire River. It is the only reliable dry-season source of water available to wildlife in a vast stretch of Tanzania's Rift Valley, attracting tremendous concentrations of animals. Look for unique species including eland, fringe-eared oryx, greater kudu and the elusive wild dog. Tarangire is also home to giraffes, waterbucks, wildebeest and zebras.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Tarangire Sopa Lodge<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B L D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>Tarangire/Ngorongoro Crater</h5>
<p>Leave Tarangire and travel overland to the Ngorongoro Crater, stopping at Mto wa Mbu, home to over 90 tribes. Wander through Mto wa Mbu Market - the setting for a scavenger hunt. With your money and a list of items, roam the stalls and bargain for the goods on your list. Continue to Gibb's Farm, where you sit down to a farm-fresh lunch, with fruit and vegetables from the farm's organic garden. To work off your lunch, you may want to walk to a nearby waterfall that weaves in and out of the forest; see caves made by elephants; or just take a stroll in the farm's beautiful gardens. From there, go on to the Ngorongoro Crater. Considered among the natural wonders of the world, the 2,000-foot-deep caldera is the result of a collapsed volcanic eruption and is a haven for many species of animals and birds. Arrive at your lodge, perched on the crater's rim, offering spectacular views across this natural amphitheater.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Ngorongoro Sopa Lodge<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B L D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5> Ngorongoro Crater</h5>
<p>Descend into the Ngorongoro Crater, searching for lions, elephants, hyenas, wildebeests and gazelles. Even the rare and elusive black rhinoceros, one of Africa's most endangered species, is a resident here. (One species you won't see is the cheetah - the crater's hyenas chased them out long ago.) Bird lovers can view flamingos and other species that share the shallow waters with big game. You may also see Maasai herdsmen walking with their cattle - the crater is in their territory, and the Maasai continue to coexist with wildlife as they have for centuries. Learn more of the Maasai's ways by visiting a local village. Notice how the Maasai women do all of the work - even build the houses. Stop for a picnic lunch near the hippo pool and watch resident hippos lazing in the river.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Ngorongoro Sopa Lodge<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B L D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>Ngorongoro Crater/Serengeti National Park</h5>
<p>After breakfast, leave Ngorongoro and fly to Serengeti National Park. Arrive at your Maasai-style lodge, where the comfortable guest rooms overlook the Serengeti plains. This afternoon, set off on your first game drive in the park. Famed throughout Africa and around the world, its 10,000 square miles support a variety of animals, including lions, leopards, hyenas, cheetahs, giraffes and topi. Each year, the Serengeti is the scene of the spectacular seasonal wildebeest and zebra migration, when millions of these animals trek through to Kenya's Masai Mara in search of fresh grass and water. The sight of so many animals, from the air or on the ground, is an awe-inspiring experience.

<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>Serengeti National Park</h5>
<p>Embark on an optional hot air balloon ride over the boundless Serengeti plains, just as animals begin to stir. Watch below as graceful giraffes lope along, seemingly in slow motion, or see if you can locate elephant families rolling in the mud of a watering hole. The Serengeti's diverse terrain supports an equally wide array of flora and fauna, which you see firsthand during today's game drives. The Serengeti ecosystem is one of the oldest on earth, where climate, vegetation and fauna have barely changed in the past million years. This evening, all travelling families gather for a farewell dinner - it's the perfect time to swap stories about memorable sightings and toast a never-to-be-forgotten stay.

<p>Lake Manyara Serena Lodge is dramatically situated on top of the Mto Wa Mbu escarpment, overlooking the vast expanse of the Great Rift Valley. The 66 rooms blend gracefully with the serene natural surroundings and the lodge is located only a few minutes from Lake Manyara National Park. For those who want some time out of their vehicles, the lodge supports a number of nature trails and also has a resident naturalist to enhance the experience.

<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>Ngorongoro Crater</h5>
<p>Enjoy an early breakfast before venturing out on your game drive. From your lodge on the crater rim descend to the crater floor by 4WD safari vehicle for a morning unlike any other you will experience in Africa. Spot some of the rarer species in Africa like the black rhino against the spectacular backdrop of the crater's forest covered walls.

<p>The floor of the crater is only 100 square miles but is home to around 30,000 animals with a high concentration of predators and some of the finest black-maned lions in Africa.

<p>Serengeti Serena Lodge is located high on a hill offering magnificent views of the Serengeti Plains. The lodge is pure Africa.

The simple style is enhanced with sophisticated detail in the form of traditional handicraft, such as wood carvings, beadwork and pottery designs. The lodge offers its own unique game trails devised in conjunction with park consultants to allow enjoyment of the Serengeti's unequalled variety of game.</p>

<h5>Serengeti</h5>
<p>Spend a full day exploring the Serengeti by 4WD vehicle with thrilling morning and afternoon game drives. Whether this is your first time on safari or a return trip, the Serengeti will not disappoint.</p>
<p>The Serengeti National Park is arguably the most famous national park in the world. The Serengeti perhaps defines the safari experience as surely as the wildlife that inhabits it. Established in 1951, and covering an area of almost 15,000 square kilometers, an area comparable to the state of Connecticut or Northern Ireland, the Serengeti hosts a fantastically diverse ecosystem. The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, when 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other game that follow close behind make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.</p>

</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>Arrive Nairobi </h5>
<p>Arrive at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport and transfer to the Norfolk Hotel.</p>
<p>Probably Kenya's most famous hotel - and certainly one of its oldest - The Norfolk has been drawing the rich and famous to its hallowed doors since they first opened on Christmas Day 1904. In many respects, Nairobi grew up around the Norfolk, which occupies a central but quiet location opposite the National Theatre.</p>
<p>Just south of the equator Nairobi's main avenues blaze with colour from tropical bushes and vines. The nearby Nairobi National Park boasts the presence of all but one of the`Big Five'. Shopping in Nairobi varies from African clothing and craft shops to open-air markets. There are excellent museums, offering insights into the fauna, culture and history of Kenya.</p>
<p>The rest of the day is free to relax or if time permits, enjoy some sightseeing.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> The Norfolk Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Nairobi - Amboseli  </h5>
<p>After breakfast, begin your drive south to Amboseli.</p>
<p>Arrive at Amboseli Serena Lodge in time for lunch.</p>
<p>Sitting in the formidable shadow of Africa's highest mountain, Amboseli Serena Lodge offers luxurious rooms and fine dining in one of Kenya's purest natural settings. Accommodation is in well-spaced rooms designed along the lines of traditional Maasai manyattas and decorated with authentic Africana and attractive murals painted by a local artist. A natural spring and waterhole in the lodge's immediate vicinity draw a steady stream of big game, from lion, buffalo, giraffe and wildebeest to some of Africa's largest elephant herds. The lodge also features a sculpted swimming pool and there are several protected jogging trails.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Amboseli Serena Safari Lodge<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D </p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>Amboseli</h5>
<p>A full day to explore Amboseli National Park.</p>
<p>Amboseli lies southeast of Nairobi, at the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro.  The snow-capped peak of Mount Kilimanjaro rising above a saucer of clouds, dominates every aspect of the park and provides a backdrop to a spectacular display of wildlife - lion, elephant, leopard, rhino, cheetah, buffalo and a host of plains game. The Tanzania border runs along its base and also forms the boundary of the park. Amboseli has five main wildlife habitats- open plains, acacia woodland, rocky thorn bush country, swamps and marshland.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Amboseli Serena Safari Lodge  <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D  </p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>Amboseli - Namanga - Arusha - Manyara </h5>
<p>Breakfast at the lodge and then drive to the Kenya/Tanzania border town of Namanga. After immigration and customs formalities meet your Tanzania driver guides and drive to the town of Arusha for lunch.</p>
<p>After lunch continue to Manyara. Dramatically situated on top of the Mto Wa Mbu escarpment, overlooking the vast expanse of the Great Rift Valley, the rooms blend gracefully with the serene natural surroundings. The lodge is located only a few minutes from Lake Manyara National Park.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Manyara Serena<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D  </p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>Manyara - Ngorongoro</h5>
<p>This morning enjoy a game drive in the park before driving to the Ngorongoro Conservation area.</p>
<p>Stop at Gibbs Farm, an old-colonial farmhouse for lunch. Built by German settlers in the early 20th century, the house still has the character of a well-looked after private house with log fires and friendly service. It lies perched on the outer slopes of the Ngorongoro Crater Highlands and is surrounded by coffee plantations and a vegetable farm with views over this lush agricultural area.</p>
<p>After lunch continue to the  Ngorongoro Serena Lodge which is nestled on the rim of the Ngorongoro Crater, one of the natural wonders of the world.</p>
<p>Your lodge is designed in stone and wood.  The vegetation around is left natural, so the lodge is almost unseen as it blends in with its natural surroundings. All rooms have breathtaking views of the crater.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Ngorongor Serena Safari Lodge<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D  </p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>Ngorongoro Crater</h5>
<p>This morning drive down the crater walls and spend the full day game viewing in the crater.</p>
<p>The Ngorongoro Cater is the world's largest intact caldera. With an area of just 260 kmÂ² (102 square miles) the Ngorongoro is a true Garden of Eden. Highland forest covers the 610 metre (2,000 ft) sheer sides of the caldera, a spectacular barrier encircling and protecting the roaming plains wildlife which patrol the flat crater floor. This is a world of wide grassland plains, acacia copses, pools and streams. All the 'Big Five' are here - elephant, buffalo, lion, leopard and even rhino can still be found. The central soda lake attracts birds and sometimes flocks of flamingo.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Ngorongoro Serena Safari Lodge<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D  </p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>Ngorongoro Crater - Serengeti</h5>
<p>Enjoy a hearty breakfast at the lodge before beginning your drive to Olduvai Gorge, often called the "Cradle of Mankind". This is one of the most important prehistoric sites in the world. The museum at the site shows how this area played an important part in understanding early human evolution.</p>
<p>Leaving Olduvai continue to the Serengeti, one of the most magnificent parks in Africa. On arrival at the park drive to your lodge with game viewing en-route. Serengeti is the home of the great wildebeest migration and the short grass plains around your accommodation provide the perfect setting for the wildebeest as they mass around the area during the birthing of their young in the early months of each year.</p>
<p>Kusini is perfectly located in a private corner of the Serengeti and sited among a cluster of kopjes (beautiful outcrops of granite rock).  Part of Kusini's charm is its remote and private location within the park borders and with no other camps in the near vicinity Kusini offers exceptional and essentially private game viewing.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Kusini<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 8</h4>
<h5>Serengeti</h5>
<p>A full day to explore the Serengeti.</p>
<p>The Serengeti's abundance of game is legendary and it is famed for the annual wildebeest and zebra migration which mass on its grassland plains, dotted with acacia.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Kusini<br />  
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 9</h4>
<h5>Serengeti - Masai Mara</h5>
<p>This morning after breakfast take a scheduled flight to Kilimanjaro Airport and connect with your flight to Nairobi. Upon arrival in Nairobi fly to the famous Masai Mara Game Reserve.</p>
<p>On landing at the airstrip, your guide will meet you. Take a short game drive en route to your camp. You may be rewarded with sightings of elephant, buffalo, giraffe and a host of other plains game.</p>
<p>Olonana is at the forefront of eco-tourism in Kenya with solar power, bio degradable products and an ingenious wetlands project which allows for all used water to be totally recycled and returned to the river clean.</p>
<p>Your room is a permanent canvas structure. The camp comprises of just 14 spacious and airy en suite accommodation tents; all with floor to ceiling mosquito net 'windows' and river view verandahs.</p>
<p>Lunch is served at the main cottage's lounge and dining area, its spacious verandah overlooks the river where the resident hippo pods spend their days wallowing.</p>
<p>After lunch there is time to relax before enjoying an activity of your choice.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Olonana<br />  
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D  </p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 10</h4>
<h5>Masai Mara</h5>
<p>The next two days are yours to enjoy game viewing as you venture out in open 4X4 vehicles led by your expert driver/guide. A wide range of activities are offered at Olonana and you can plan your day to be as active or as leisurely as you wish. Visit the adjacent Maasai village, take a morning bush walk with an armed ranger or enjoy sundowners in the evening or even dinner under the stars in the middle of the African bush.</p>
<p>In the Mara, the wildlife is abundant and the swaying grasslands ensure that animals are never out of sight. Elephants browse amongst the large herds of wildebeest, topi, gazelle, eland and buffalo. The plains offer a rich variety of food for the dominant predators: lion, leopard, hyena and cheetah. In the Mara River, hippos submerge while crocodiles sunbathe on the riverbanks.</p>
<p>Around July to September, rain depending, the Masai Mara is host to the famous wildebeest migration which is one of the few remaining mass migrations of mammals in the world. During this time herds of over a million wildebeest will trawl their way through this region and they become the major focus for predatory activity and drama unfolds at every corner.</p>
<p>There are also options for a morning balloon safari or a half-day visit to Lake Victoria.</p>
<p>Balloon Safari: As the balloon is inflated against the first rays of sunrise your pilot will go through safety procedures. Once aloft, the balloon floats gently over the plains, giving a bird's eye view of the game below as the sun creeps slowly over the horizon. After around one hour the balloon lands as breakfast is already being prepared and, of course, enjoy a glass or two of bubbly to toast your flight in a tradition initiated by the Montgolfier brothers. </p>
<p>Lake Victoria Adventure : An early start this morning with a transfer to the airstrip for a flight by light aircraft to Lake Victoria. On arrival enjoy an appetising full English breakfast before you board the boat for the morning. There will be the opportunity to try fishing for the legendary giant Nile perch found in these waters as you explore the myriad of tiny islands in this region of the lake. An experienced and knowledgeable fisherman captains each boat. There is the chance to stop at a traditional fishing village and see how the villagers live from day to day before returning to the airstrip for your return flight to the Masai Mara.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Olonana<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D  </p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 11</h4>
<h5>Masai Mara - Depart Nairobi / Option to extend to Lamu Island</h5>
<p>After breakfast transfer to the airstrip for your scheduled flight back to Nairobi. Upon arrival at Wilson Airport, you will be transferred to Norfolk Hotel where dayrooms have been reserved. The rest of the day is free for you to relax and freshen up, or go sightseeing and shopping.</p>
<p>This evening transfer to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport for your international departure flight. </p>
<p><strong>Option to extend to Lamu Island</strong></p>
<p>Fly from Masai Mara to Nairobi. On arrival in Nairobi you will be transferred to the Carnivore Restaurant for lunch. Situated on the edge of Nairobi National Park, the focal point of the main restaurant is the roasting pit where a staggering array of both game and domestic meat is roasted on huge metal spears. Waiters bring these different meats to the table and carve onto piping hot plates. For herbivores, there is an extensive vegetarian menu.</p>
<p>Transfer back to Wilson Airport for a scheduled flight to Manda Island. On arrival, the Peponi staff will be there to meet you and take you by boat to your hotel on Lamu Island, an unspoiled island just off the coast of Kenya.</p>
<p>Peponi was opened in 1967 and it still retains much of the character and charm that it had then, as the ultimate 'home from home' retreat on  Lamu Island.  Tucked into its own headland, with the bustling Swahili town of Shela on one side and the sweep of a shimmering beach on the other, Peponi occupies a special position between the old and new worlds. As well as gentle journeys aboard ancient dhows, the hotel offers a host of water sports, from water skiing and windsurfing to scuba diving and bountiful big game fishing.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Peponi Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D  </p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 12</h4>
<h5>Lamu Island</h5>
<p>Lamu is an ancient Arab island, blissfully lost in the tides of history with its historical mosques and  narrow streets. Donkey is the main form of transport as there are no cars on the island's narrow streets which are very much as they were centuries ago. </p>
<p>Two days at leisure to relax and fall into the peace, tranquility and coastal pace of this unique island.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Peponi Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 13</h4>
<h5>Lamu - Depart Nairobi</h5>
<p>After breakfast transfer by boat to the airstrip for your scheduled flight back to Nairobi. Upon arrival at Wilson Airport, you will be transferred to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport for your international departure flight.</p>

A wide range of activities are offered at Olonana and you can plan your day to be as active or as leisurely as you wish. Visit the adjacent Maasai village, take a morning bush walk with an armed ranger or enjoy sundowners in the evening or even dinner under the stars in the middle of the African bush.<br /><br />In the Mara, the wildlife is abundant and the swaying grasslands ensure that animals are never out of sight. Elephants browse amongst the large herds of wildebeest, topi, gazelle, eland and buffalo. The plains offer a rich variety of food for the dominant predators: lion, leopard, hyena and cheetah. In the Mara River, hippos submerge while crocodiles sunbathe on the riverbanks.<br /><br />Around July to September, rain depending, the Masai Mara is host to the famous wildebeest migration which is one of the few remaining mass migrations of mammals in the world. During this time herds of over a million wildebeest will trawl their way through this region and they become the major focus for predatory activity and drama unfolds at every corner.<br /><br />There are also options for a morning balloon safari or a half-day visit to Lake Victoria.<br /><br />Balloon Safari: As the balloon is inflated against the first rays of sunrise your pilot will go through safety procedures. Once aloft, the balloon floats gently over the plains, giving a bird's eye view of the game below as the sun creeps slowly over the horizon. After around one hour the balloon lands as breakfast is already being prepared and, of course, enjoy a glass or two of bubbly to toast your flight in a tradition initiated by the Montgolfier brothers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lake Victoria Adventure : An early start this morning with a transfer to the airstrip for a flight by light aircraft to Lake Victoria. On arrival enjoy an appetising full English breakfast before you board the boat for the morning. There will be the opportunity to try fishing for the legendary giant Nile perch found in these waters as you explore the myriad of tiny islands in this region of the lake. An experienced and knowledgeable fisherman captains each boat. There is the chance to stop at a traditional fishing village and see how the villagers live from day to day before returning to the airstrip for your return flight to the Masai Mara.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p>";

<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong>  9 days</p>
<p>Discover Tanzania's varied wilderness and wildlife with this exclusive itinerary.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong> Selous Game Reserve, Lake Manyara, Ngorongoro Crater, Serengeti National Park.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>Arrive Selous Game Reserve</h5>
<p>Arrive at Dar es Salaam International airport where you will be met and assisted with your onward flight. Fly from Dar es Salaam to the remote Selous Game Reserve. Upon arrival you are met by a camp representative and transferred to your camp to settle in. This afternoon explore the Selous either by foot on a walking safari, by boat on the Rufiji and Lake Tagala, or in open 4WD vehicles. All excursions are escorted by an experienced armed guide.</p>
<p>Selous Sand Rivers is situated on the banks of the Rufiji River, offering a unique combination of adventure, comfort and exclusivity. This small luxury lodge, crafted out of local materials, comprises six individually designed cottages with en-suite bathrooms. Spaced along the river bank, each has its own private view of the wide sand-banked river with its hippos, crocodiles and birdlife. Near the dining area a large baobab tree shades the swimming pool in which guests can escape the heat of the sun or cool off after a game walk.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Selous Sand Rivers<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Selous</h5>
<p>Today enjoy morning and afternoon game activities in the bush where your game sightings will rarely be interrupted by other vehicles. Enjoy the solitude whilst observing elephants, lions, buffalo, hippos and crocodiles. Game drives are conducted by 4WD vehicles or from your river boat, the more adventurous of you may like to stretch your legs with a walking safari.</p>
<p>The Selous Game Reserve is the largest game reserve in the world and has some of the finest virgin bush left in Africa, where the last of the really big-tusked elephants and large-maned lions roam. The Selous supports around one million game animals, is bigger than Switzerland and is a World Heritage site. From March to May floods sweep the valley, forcing the game on to the 'islands' of higher ground, where elephant, buffalo, lion, leopard, crocodile, puku, buck, eland, sable and others concentrate.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Selous Sand Rivers <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D </p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>Selous</h5>
<p>Enjoy another day at leisure to be as active as you like. You may like to explore the Selous overland by 4WD vehicle or on a bush walk, or take to the river on a boat trip. Alternatively you may like to relax at your camp with a book on your private verandah or cool off in the camp's pool.</p>
<p>The Selous is Africa's largest wildlife sanctuary and one of its least known treasures. Covering 21,000 square miles of completely undeveloped land, the Selous is one of the last great tracts of true wilderness left in Africa.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Selous Sand Rivers<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D  </p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>Selous - Arusha - Lake Manyara</h5>
<p>Wake up early this morning as you prepare for a long day of travel to Ngorongoro. Transfer to the airstrip for your flight from the Selous to Arusha. Upon arrival at Arusha airport you will be met by your private driver/guide who will escort you for the duration of your safari in Tanzania. Transfer from Arusha to Ngorongoro Crater Lodge located on the rim with spectacular views across the crater. The Ngorongoro Crater is the largest unbroken caldera in the world and the first sight of it is breathtaking.</p>
<p>Ngorongoro Crater Lodge is situated on the edge of the ancient crater rim above the cool, swirling mists. The lodge is a return to the noble elegance of the travelling colonials. Inspired in design by the Maasai Manyatta, three separate camps of 6 to 12 suites each remember a bygone era when characters such as Lord Delamere adorned the stilted, handcrafted structures with graceful antiques, grand chandeliers and treasures collected from travels through Africa.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Ngorongoro Crater Lodge<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D  </p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>Ngorongoro Crater</h5>
<p>Enjoy an early breakfast before venturing out on your game drive. From your lodge on the crater rim descend to the crater floor by 4WD safari vehicle for a morning unlike any other you will experience in Africa. Spot some of the rarer species in Africa like the black rhino against the spectacular backdrop of the crater's forest covered walls. Enjoy a picnic lunch amongst the hippos and birds before visiting a Maasai village this afternoon.</p>
<p>The floor of the crater is only 100 sq miles but is home to around 30,000 animals with a high concentration of predators and some of the finest black-maned lions in Africa. Rhinos can often be seen with calves at heel. Eland and waterbuck appear not to notice the human visitors, enabling photographers to shoot at ease. On the lake in the middle of the crater you may see thousands of flamingos fluttering and shimmering like a pink heat haze. Zebra and wildebeest account for almost half the animals. Gazelle, buffalo, eland, hartebeest and wart hog can also be seen.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Ngorongoro Crater Lodge<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D  </p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>Ngorongoro Crater - Serengeti</h5>
<p>Following breakfast this morning transfer to Olduvai Gorge, the cradle of mankind, made famous by Dr Leaky's discovery of fossil fragments dating back some 3.5 million years. After a picnic lunch continue to your camp located in the southern reaches of Serengeti National Park.</p>
<p>Kusini Camp is built in and around a large kopje. The camp offers spectacular views across Tortillis woodland situated on the edge of the short grass plains. The camp is comprised of nine double tents scattered around the kopje with the mess tent and common area as the central feature. Privacy between tents is guaranteed as they are at a substantial distance from each other and are generally concealed by a tree or kopje.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Kusini Camp<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D  </p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>Serengeti</h5>
<p>This morning awake to a steaming hot cup of tea or coffee served on the decking of your tent before enjoying breakfast at the main tent. Enjoy a full day exploring the Serengeti by 4WD vehicle with thrilling morning and afternoon game drives. Whether this is your first time on safari or a return trip the Serengeti will not disappoint.</p>
<p>The Serengeti National Park is arguably the most famous national park in the world. The Serengeti perhaps defines the safari experience as surely as the wildlife that inhabits it. Established in 1951, and covering an area of almost 15,000 sq km, an area comparable to the state of Connecticut or Northern Ireland, the Serengeti hosts a fantastically diverse ecosystem. The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, where 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other plains game that follow close behind, make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Kusini Camp<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 8</h4>
<h5>Serengeti</h5>
<p>Today enjoy another full day discovering the spirit of the Serengeti by 4WD vehicle with exciting morning and afternoon game drives.</p>
<p>The Serengeti National Park lies between the Ngorongoro Highlands, Lake Victoria and Tanzania's northern border with Kenya. The name comes from the Maasai meaning "endless plains". The Serengeti contains about three million large animals, most taking part in seasonal migrations, unparalleled in nature. Be sure to have your camera constantly at hand as life in the Serengeti is always action packed.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Kusini Camp<br />  
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 9</h4>
<h5>Depart Serengeti</h5>
<p>Today leave the Serengeti behind as you transfer to the airstrip for your flight to Arusha. On arrival you will be met and transferred to Arusha Coffee Lodge where a room is available for use until your onward flight later this evening. Transfer to Kilimanjaro International Airport for your departure.</p>
<p>After lunch there is time to relax before enjoying an activity of your choice.</p>
