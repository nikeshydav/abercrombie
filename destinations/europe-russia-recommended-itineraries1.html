<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong>  12 days</p>
<p>This itinerary is linked to the 400th anniversary of the Romanov dynasty. Beginning in Moscow where the Romanov dynasty was born in 1613,
the tour continues to Yekaterinburg in Western Siberia where the dynasty met its tragic end in 1918 and on to St Petersburg, where most
Romanov rulers lived in 18th-19th centuries.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong> Moscow, Zaryadye, Tolmachi, Kazan, Yekaterinburg, St Petersburg, Pushkin, Peterhof</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>Arrive Moscow</h5><br>
<h4>Arrival Transfer</h4>
<p>Upon arrival at Moscow airport, meet your expert local guide in the arrivals hall and transfer to your hotel.</p>
<h4>Evening activities</h4>
<p>You may wish to visit the famous Red Square to view St. Basil’s Cathedral, Lenin’s Tomb and the glamorous GUM Department store.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Kremlin with Armoury museum and Grand Kremlin palace</h5><br>
<h4>Morning activities</h4>
<p>
Begin your full-day sightseeing tour with a visit to the State Armoury. The armoury is the oldest museum in Russia and home to a collection of
precious stones, masterpieces of 18th and 19th century jewellery and priceless artefacts dating as far back as the 14th century, as well as an
impressive collection of carriages from the best Russian and European masters, precious fabrics, and royal gala clothes. The museum is also
famous for its fine collection of Fabergé eggs.
</p>
<p>The Armoury houses the collection of the Diamond Fund where one can see the most famous pieces of the Romanovs’ jewellery on display.
Highlights of the collection include Catherine the Great's stunningly lavish coronation crown (also called the Great Imperial Crown), the world's
largest sapphire, the famous Orlov Diamond, and a collection of gold and platinum nuggets.</p>
<p>Continue your tour of the Kremlin Territory. For centuries, the Kremlin has been witness to many famous and tragic events in Russia’s past and
has become a treasure trove of Russian history. Visit two of the Kremlin’s cathedrals: Assumption, the place of coronations and the burial church
of religious leaders, and Archangel, the royal burial church.</p>
<p>Enjoy lunch at leisure.</p><br>
<h4>Afternoon activities</h4>
<p>Continue your day with a visit to the magnificent Red Square. The focal point of the city, the square lies on the east wall of the Kremlin
surrounded by a thick red fortress wall containing 20 towers all at various intervals. Originally allotted for a market, the square itself appeared
around the end of the 15th century when Ivan III ordered all wooden buildings in the vicinity of the Kremlin to be demolished to protect the Kremlin
from fires. Directly opposite the Mausoleum, on the eastern side of the square, lies the building which houses Russia's most famous shopping
mall - the Main Department Store, GUM. Built at the turn of the 19th Century the complex boasts an elegantly-decorated interior, comprising of
three parallel arcades, centered around a fountain and roofed by a splendid glass ceiling - magnificent! You should not miss the chance to taste
the legendary GUM ice-cream.</p>

</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>Romanov Chambers and Tretyakov Gallery</h5>
<h4>Morning activities</h4>
<p>
Begin your day with a visit to the Romanov Chambers located in Zaryadye, the oldest trading settlement outside the Kremlin walls. It is a
genuinely fascinating and appealing museum that gives an unusually complete glimpse of a world unknown to most Russians, let alone foreign
visitors. Since 1859, it has operated as a museum, one of the first in city, offering visitors an opportunity to experience aristocratic life of Russian
boyars in the Moscow of the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>Afterwards visit the Tretyakov Gallery, containing the best collection of Russian art in the world. Reopened in 1995 after a nine-year renovation, it
houses an outstanding display of pre-revolutionary Russian art as well as an extensive collection of icons.</p>
<p>You have a unique chance to visit the museum cathedral of St. Nicholas in Tolmachi, which is part of the Tretyakov Art Gallery. There you will
listen to church hymns sung by the St. Nicholas Spiritual Choir of the Tretyakov Art Gallery. St. Nicholas Choir of the Tretyakov Art Gallery has
won the reputation as one of the best choirs of Russia. The choir is remarkable for its high vocal culture, perfect performance, convincingness of
interpretation. The choir performs Russian church musical pieces.</p>
<p>The afternoon tour will take you to the Tsereteli Art Gallery (a beautiful mansion of the late 18th century close to the Cathedral of Christ the
Saviour). This art gallery is a marvellous place decorated with frescos, bronze bas-reliefs and mosaics of the famous Russian sculptor Zurab
Tsereteli – President of the Russian Academy of Arts.</p>
<p>Visit the gallery itself featuring some very interesting pieces of contemporary art. See the composition dedicated to the perished family of the last
Russia Tsar Nikolai Romanov.</p><br>
<h4>Afternoon activities</h4>
<p>Tour the famous Metro, constructed under Stalin. Travel on the trains seeing some of the most impressive and flamboyant stations that are
veritable museum pieces in themselves.</p>
<p>Tonight you may wish to attend a ballet or opera performance at the world-famous Bolshoi Theatre which has recently re-opened after six long
year of restoration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>Depart Moscow</h5>
<p>
This morning, after checking out of your hotel, depart for a visit to the Novodevichy Monastery, which has witnessed many turbulent events in the
history of Moscow and the Romanov dynasty. Continue to the near-by Memorial Cemetery, the resting place of some of Russia’s most famous
authors, artists, and politicians.
</p>
<p>Afterwards visit the Arbat street for lunch at leisure.</p>
<p>Transfer to the airport for your flight to Kazan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>Kazan</h5>
<p>
This morning enjoy the tour of Russia’s “Third Capital,” Kazan. Founded in the 11th century, it is one of Russia’s oldest centres of culture,
science, and trade. An architectural tour introduces us to the enormous and eclectic Kremlin, including the Kul-Sharif Mosque, one of the largest
in Europe; and the 16th-century Annunciation Cathedral.</p>
<p>Enjoy the evening at leisure</p>
</li>


<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>Yekaterinburg</h5>
<h4>Morning Activities</h4>
<p>
This morning fly to Yekaterinburg, Russia’s borderline between Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>Explore Yekaterinburg on a city orientation tour. Visit the main historical sights: the Historical Square where in 1723 the main Ural plant was built
along the oldest hydraulic engineering work, the first plant dam, and the places that are connected with the name of the First Russian President -
Boris Yeltsin. As well as the merchant’s mansions of gold-fever time, you will also see modern shopping centers, the theatrical quarter and the
University. The highlight of the tour will be a visit to the newly built Cathedral on Spilled Blood, dedicated to the family of the last Romanovs.</p>
<p>Check in at your hotel.</p><br>
<h4>Afternoon Activities</h4>
<p>This afternoon visit “the Borderline between Europe and Asia” which starts in the eastern part of the city and continues into the western one. It
runs through the Great Siberian (Moscow) highway to a column obelisk – the “Europe and Asia boundary” established on the crossroads of two
parts of the world.</p>

highest of monarchs” and a visit to Versailles in 1717 furthered these ambitions. Over 5000 labourers, serfs and soldiers were employed in the
creation of this magnificent estate that was officially opened in 1723. Your fast track entrance to the Great Palace will allow you to avoid the
queues and marvel at the Palace's lavish décor without the crowds. A prominent highlight is the Grand Cascade, a delightful sequence of 37

<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>MOSCOW</h5>
<p>Today travel with your private vehicle and guide to the New Maiden Convent, one of the city's most beautiful architectural ensembles with a long history behind its toothed walls. Founded as a fortress in the south of Moscow, it gradually became a place of political activity. The adjacent New Maiden Cemetery is Moscow's most prestigious resting place after the Kremlin wall, containing the tombs of Chekhov, Shostakovich, Stanislavsky, Khrushchev, Gromyko, Molotov, Raisa Gorbachev and others. See some more sites of the city before your independent lunch.</p>
<p>
In the afternoon continue to the Tretyakov Gallery, containing the best collection of Russian art in the world. Reopened in 1995 after a nine-year renovation, it houses an outstanding display of pre-revolutionary Russian art as well as an extensive collection of icons. As a special treat, enjoy a concert by a Russian Orthodox choir in the near-by Church of St. Nickolas the Miracle Maker.</p>

Rhinos can be seen with calves at heel. Eland and waterbuck appear not to notice the human visitors, enabling photographers to shoot at ease. On the lake in the middle of the crater you may see thousands of flamingos, fluttering and shimmering like a pink heat haze.

The Serengeti perhaps defines the safari experience as surely as the wildlife that inhabits it. Established in 1951, and covering an area of almost 15,000 square kilometers, an area comparable to the state of Connecticut or Northern Ireland, the Serengeti hosts a fantastically diverse ecosystem. The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, when 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other game that follow close behind make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";
