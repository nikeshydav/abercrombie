<p>Birthplace of Abercrombie & Kent, Kenya is a must visit for those who want to embody nature's splendid beauty on their trip. Savannahs, vast tracts of open space, crater lakes, mountains, golden sand-beaches and abundant wildlife are what make Kenya a unique place.</p>
<p><strong>Holidays in Kenya</strong> with Abercrombie & Kent go to a different level of service with each traveller being dealt exclusively by our trained team of travel experts. Luxurious accommodation (from stylish bush homes to secluded tented-camps), exotic locale and sightseeing opportunities have a flavour of the country. Same goes for our <strong>A&K Luxury Kenya safari</strong>.</p>
<p>At A&K, we provide luxurious <a href="http://www.abercrombiekent.co.in/journeystyles/private-mob-copm.html">Private Mobile Camping</a> for those who want to have a first-hand experience of staying in the African bush. Privacy, luxury and comfort are taken utmost care of while you sleep under the stars. Get awed by the colourful and rich ancient-culture of over 40 tribes while enjoying the exceptional game viewing that Kenya offers.</p>
<p>Home to some of the best national parks and game reserves of <a href="http://www.abercrombiekent.co.in/destinations/africa.html">Africa</a>, Kenya is a world within itself. The snow-capped mountains, semi-arid desert, vast land of rainforests and beautiful savannahs make up its diverse ecological balance. An addition to this list is the flamingo lakes, the white palm-fringed ocean beaches and the coral reefs. With tree hotels, mobile camp and lodges built in prime wildlife locations; there are various options to explore the natural beauty. You will love travelling and exploring the country, all the more because of its mild climate.</p>
<p>The country is host to the annual wildebeest migration that happens only in East Africa. A spectacular sight to watch, at Mara Serengeti it is estimated that over two million animals migrate in a year-round pattern moving to greener pastures for food.</p>
<p>Kenya offers a wide range of activities from biking to camel and horse riding safaris, underwater sports like snorkelling and diving, trekking at Mount Kenya, white water rafting, fishing and playing golf for the silent hearts.</p>

<h1>Best Time to Go Kenya</h1>

<div class="Clr"></div>

<h4>Best time to go to Kenya </h4>
<p class="font13">Best time to go: June to October, December to March <br />
Best value time to go: April, May and November
</p>
<p>Kenya is a year round destination and has something different to offer visitors throughout the year. In January and February it is hot and dry, and the animals gather round the water sources making for easy game viewing. There are also large concentrations of bird life on some of the Rift Valley lakes around this time. March to May is the green season and for some this is the best time to travel - the rain usually falls in short showers with bursts of sunshine in between, making everything refreshingly beautiful and green. July to September are the country's coolest months and the famous wildebeest migration is traditionally present in Kenya around this time. The incredible migration only happens in East Africa and around this time the grasslands of the Masai Mara in Kenya are covered by a mass of moving wildebeest as far as the eye can see. October to January is also a delightful time to visit Kenya and compares to springtime, the days are warm and the evenings cool. Short, scattered rains fall in November to freshen up the country and lay the dust. This is also a good time for snorkelling and diving off the coast.</p>

<div class="tabtxtHolder">
<div class="tabtxtHolder-top"></div>
<div class="tabtxtHolder-mid">
<div id="tab1"><p>In Kenya, the unit of currency is the Kenya Shilling, which is divided into 100 Cents.  Notes are issued in denominations of 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 Shillings. Coins are issued in denominations of 5, 10, and 50 Cents and 1, 5, 10, 20 and 40 Shillings.</p></div>
<div id="tab2" style="display:none;"><p>The small amount of local currency you may need during your stay in Kenya can be obtained at authorised facilities (such as at authorised hotels, banks and foreign exchange bureaus).  Clients going directly on safari upon arrival in Nairobi may exchange money at the airport currency exchange if they wish.</p></div>
<div id="tab3" style="display:none;">
<p>Porters: A tip of US $1.00 per person is appropriate for two pieces of baggage at airports, hotels, lodges and camps. If you are traveling with more than two pieces of baggage, an additional tip of US $1.00 per bag is recommended.</p>

<p>Driver-Guide: One driver-guide accompanies each land vehicle on safari.  It is customary to tip your driver-guide on the last day you are with him or her.  Approximately US $5 - US $7 per traveller per day is considered a good tip for a driver-guide (based on 4 - 6 travellers in a vehicle).  If there are only 2 or 3 travellers in a vehicle, you may consider raising this amount to approximately US $6 - US $8 per traveller per day in recognition of the individual attention given to a smaller size group.</p>
<p>Safari Escort: In addition to a driver-guide, some groups are accompanied by a professional safari escort.  It is customary to tip your safari escort on the last day you are with him or her, and the recommended tip is US $8 to US $10 per traveller, per day.  As with the tip for a driver guide, smaller groups (in this case, 5 or less) might consider tipping slightly more - in the range of approximately US $10 - US $12 per traveller per day.</p>

<p>Mobile Camping: If you are travelling on an mobile camping safari (either independently or on a programme) you will be served by a camp manager and several staff, for whom an overall tip of US $10 - US $14 per traveller per day in camp is recommended.  This should be given to your guide on the last day for distribution among all camp staff.  Again, smaller groups (in the case of 5 or less) might consider tipping in the slightly higher range of approximately US $12 - US $18 per traveller, per day (this applies to the exclusive camps, where tips are not included, and not to the permanent tented camps).</p></div>
<div id="tab4" style="display:none;">For full details on climate, please see <a href="africa-kenya-best-time.html" title="Best Time to Go">Best Time to Go</a>.</div>
<div id="tab5" style="display:none;"><p>Dress on safari is usually casual.  Because it can be dusty, neutral colors are most practical for game viewing.  Although you should dress for outdoor comfort in Kenya, remember to include one or two smarter outfits for dining in larger cities. Note:  Travellers visiting Mount Kenya Safari Club should be advised that smart casual dress is now acceptable for dinner.</p>

<p>Temperatures tend to be cooler in the early morning and after sunset - but warm up considerably by midday.  (An exception to this is the highlands region around Aberdare Park, where temperatures tend to be cool throughout the day.)  To be prepared for such temperature variations and to maximise the versatility of your travel wardrobe, we recommend packing lightweight clothing that can be layered.</p>

<p>A lined jacket or warm sweater is recommended and around June, July, and August (Kenya's "winter"), you will want to pack a heavier jacket or sweater.  Rain protection (lightweight raincoat) will be useful, especially if you are traveling during November or from mid-March through May.</p>

<p>Unless you have booked a walking safari, you will not need heavy footwear.  (There is little walking when game viewing is done from a vehicle.)  A pair of comfortable walking shoes with soft soles will be adequate.  Beach sandals or thongs are handy.
</p>
<p>Good sunglasses and sunblock lotion are essential for protection from Kenya's strong sun.  You may also want to bring your own fold-up sun hat. Binoculars will maximise the enjoyment of game viewing and bird watching.  A compact and lightweight pair is suggested. If you wear prescription glasses or contact lenses, we recommend that you bring an extra pair of glasses (as well as a copy of the prescription).</p></div>
<div id="tab6" style="display:none;">
<p>Yellow Fever:  If you are arriving in Kenya (or planning to re-enter) from a country where yellow fever is endemic (such as Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, or Zambia), you are required to have a yellow fever vaccination; and it must be administered at least ten days before your arrival (or re-entry) into Kenya.  If your travel itinerary requires you to have a yellow fever vaccination, you must ask your doctor to provide you with an "International Certificate of Vaccination," which should be carried with you while travelling to serve as proof that you have fulfilled the vaccination requirement.  If proof of vaccination is required and you do not carry it with you, you may be denied entry into Kenya.  Please note that, even if you are not required to obtain a yellow fever vaccination for your tour in Kenya, it is recommended that you take the vaccination.</p>

<p>Malaria:  Anti-malarial medication is strongly recommended for all travellers to Kenya.  A number of anti-malarial drugs are available and your doctor can prescribe the best choice based on your own health history and your specific destination(s) in Africa.</p>

<p>Cholera:  The cholera vaccination affords only moderate and short-lived protection, and the health officials do not routinely recommend a cholera vaccination for travel to or from an infected area.  Be aware that, since cholera is a water-borne disease associated with areas of poor sanitation, the best protection against the disease is the practice of good personal hygiene and the avoidance of tap water.</p>

<p>It is also recommended that all international travellers ensure that their tetanus, Hepatitis A, and polio vaccines are up-to-date.</p>

<p>Do not drink (or brush your teeth with) the tap water in Kenya.</p>

<p>It is also suggested that you assemble a traveller's medical kit appropriate to your destination, length of trip, and general health.  Your physician can advise you on specific items to include.  You should include an adequate supply of any prescribed medications you may require while travelling.</p>

<p>For up to date information on latest health and vaccination recommendations, please contact your doctor.</p></div>
<div id="tab7" style="display:none;">
<p>In Kenya, electricity runs at 220/240 volts.</p>
<p>At most lodges, video and camera batteries can be recharged.  Lodges are unable to provide adapters.  However, be aware that at the lodges overnight recharging may not be possible where generator use restricts the availability of electricity.</p></div>
<div id="tab8" style="display:none;">
<p>We recommend that you bring all the photographic equipment you will need from home, including an ample supply of film, additional camera batteries and rechargeables. In Kenya, film and batteries are not usually for sale outside of major cities and, if available, are very expensive.  It is also suggested that you have your equipment insured before you depart.</p>

<p>Many travellers, viewing this as their "trip of a lifetime" for animal photography, bring more than one camera in case of a malfunction. Sun filters will help block glare and heat haze; a wind reduction filter may be useful for video cameras. Tripods are impractical, since most photos will be taken from your safari vehicle however a small light portable tripod can be very useful in taking slow exposures for landscapes and evening scenes.  A dustproof camera bag (or some ziplock plastic bags) and an air brush will help protect your equipment from heavy dust.</p>

<p>If you plan to travel with digital photographic and/or video equipment, make certain to pack the specific charging apparatus for each piece of equipment (as well as the appropriate socket plug adaptor and voltage converter).  We also suggest that you take into account the amount of data storage of each unit when determining the amount (if any) of additional memory discs to pack. Portable storage devices with viewing screens are also advisable to help edit and back up images. This will save carrying too many memory cards and act as extra storage if needed.</p>

<p>At most lodges, video and digital camera batteries can be recharged with adapters for North American equipment to local voltage.  Adapters must be brought since lodges are unable to provide this equipment.  However, be aware that overnight recharging may not be possible where generator use restricts the availability of electricity.</p>
<p>When photographing people, especially members of the Maasai tribe, always ask permission first.  The only exception to this is when you are photographing a public scene with a lot of people in it, aiming at no one in particular.  Because so many local people are asked for permission to be photographed, many will expect a tip or an outright fee for this. In fact, some "professional posers" make a living this way.   Always be considerate of anyone's desire not to be photographed.</p>
<p>While gameviewing in parks and reserves, some travellers get caught up in the excitement of the moment to the point of losing their sensitivity to the wildlife they are observing and the other people sharing their safari vehicle.  Please be careful not to disturb the animals by making unnecessary noises or commotion, and be conscious of sharing the best photographic views with others in your vehicle. Remember to be respectful of wildlife and the fragile ecosystem you have entered.</p>
