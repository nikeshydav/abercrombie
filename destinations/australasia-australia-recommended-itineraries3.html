A short walk to the dune lookout puts one in touch with your environment and lets you delight in the spectacular panoramic view of Kata Tjuta (the Olgas) - a very sacred place to the Aboriginal people. Arriving at Walpa Gorge (Olga Gorge) we walk into this mystic place, to hear how it has evolved over millions of years. The scale of the walls and the wind far above, add a sense of mystery here, which profoundly affects all that participate. The sky blue deepens and the great domes of Kata Tjuta (the Olgas) flush red as the tour retires to the sunset viewing area to celebrate the fantastic colour changes wrought by the sunset with the complimentary champagne. Sit back and absorb the desert solitude or relax and chat to your guide about Australia's red centre. The spectacle fades as you return to Yulara beneath a sky of brilliant stars.</p>

<h4>Day 17</h4>
<h5>Melbourne - Great Ocean Road - Melbourne</h5>
<p>Great Ocean Road Tour Full Day private excursion driver/guide. Leaving the city we head over the magnificent Westgate Bridge. This bridge offers awesome views of the Docklands, as well as a panoramic view of the city skyline. We soon arrive at Geelong and take you down to Corio Bay. Corio Bay is a wonderful mix of old wharves, wool stores and a fully restored 1930s sea bathing complex. See wonderful examples of century old housing and the 100 brightly painted bollards dotted around the bay depicting some of Geelong's local historic characters, each having its own story to tell. At Torquay the Great Ocean Road starts.</p>
<p>
Known as the world's most inspiring coastal drive, we follow its winding trail through the lush Otway rainforests, to the breathtaking, windswept drama of the Shipwreck Coast. For much of the way the road clings to the coastline, twisting and turning, every bend revealing a sight more spectacular than the last.</p>
<p>
At Lorne we will visit a lookout perched high on the hillside where you really get to see the Great Ocean Road from a bird like perspective. This will be followed by morning tea where we can possibly view some of the local surfers 'ripping it up.' Another highlight of the day is a stop at Kennett River. In this area, high in the trees is a colony of wild koalas. See these creatures in their natural habitat, hanging from trees and looking after their young, oblivious to their human onlookers.</p>
<p>
A sumptuous lunch is served at Apollo Bay before we make our way to the Shipwreck coast area of the Great Ocean Road; our first stop, The Twelve Apostles. The mighty Twelve Apostles are world-recognised icons of the Great Ocean Road. These giant rock stacks soar from the swirling waters of the Southern Ocean and are a central feature of the spectacular Port Campbell National Park. The dramatic and imposing limestone cliffs that are the backdrop to the Apostles tower up to 70 metres, while the tallest of the rock stacks is around 45 metres high. Venturing further west we arrive at Loch Ard Gorge. Your first view will be of towering cliffs, sparkling blue-green sea and a small, sandy beach. It's hard to imagine that the drama of one of Victoria's most tragic shipwrecks was played out at this very spot more than 120 years ago, giving its name to the gorge. Our guide will tell you the story and have you totally engrossed and mesmerised. Time permitting we get to see another one of the amazing rock formations that dot this coastline before heading inland through dairy farm country on the way back to the city.</p>

Visit the adjacent Maasai village, take a morning bush walk with an armed ranger or enjoy sundowners in the evening or even dinner under the stars in the middle of the African bush.<br /><br />In the Mara, the wildlife is abundant and the swaying grasslands ensure that animals are never out of sight. Elephants browse amongst the large herds of wildebeest, topi, gazelle, eland and buffalo. The plains offer a rich variety of food for the dominant predators: lion, leopard, hyena and cheetah. In the Mara River, hippos submerge while crocodiles sunbathe on the riverbanks.<br /><br />Around July to September, rain depending, the Masai Mara is host to the famous wildebeest migration which is one of the few remaining mass migrations of mammals in the world. During this time herds of over a million wildebeest will trawl their way through this region and they become the major focus for predatory activity and drama unfolds at every corner.<br /><br />There are also options for a morning balloon safari or a half-day visit to Lake Victoria.<br /><br />Balloon Safari: As the balloon is inflated against the first rays of sunrise your pilot will go through safety procedures. Once aloft, the balloon floats gently over the plains, giving a bird's eye view of the game below as the sun creeps slowly over the horizon. After around one hour the balloon lands as breakfast is already being prepared and, of course, enjoy a glass or two of bubbly to toast your flight in a tradition initiated by the Montgolfier brothers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lake Victoria Adventure : An early start this morning with a transfer to the airstrip for a flight by light aircraft to Lake Victoria. On arrival enjoy an appetising full English breakfast before you board the boat for the morning. There will be the opportunity to try fishing for the legendary giant Nile perch found in these waters as you explore the myriad of tiny islands in this region of the lake. An experienced and knowledgeable fisherman captains each boat.

From here you will transfer by private vehicle to rural Victoria.

Meet Duncan Barber a 4th generation farmer of this land and enjoy an exclusive visit to his sheep farm.</p>

<p>
After morning tea, it is time for you to watch as Duncan shears a sheep. Within the confines of this historic woolshed built in 1944, you will learn more about the wool industry and the rich 150 year history which can be traced back to the Elector of Saxony. The finer details of preparing and classing a fleece and the process a fleece goes through will be detailed, and this beautiful product that ends up as fabric made into Italy's finest men's suits (Zegna) is sure to impress and enthrall. This is also a chance to watch Duncan work his Australian Sheep Dogs & to plant an Australian Native Tree to commemorate your visit to the property before returning to the homestead for a three course lunch with the Barber family. Your lunch will include Australian wine, beer and water.</p>
<p>
To conclude your day, Duncan will take you for a drive around the property to spot kangaroos in their natural environment before you re-join the vehicle and journey back to Melbourne.

<h4>Day 11</h4>
<h5>Barossa Valley - Flinders Ranges</h5>
<p>This morning your eco-guide will meet you at The Louise for your 4WD adventure into the South Australia outback. This is an overland journey north 4 hours, into the spectacular Flinders Ranges. To explore the Flinders Ranges is to experience the essence of Australia. The story of the Flinders Ranges began 800 million years ago when natural forces stretched and thinned the earth's crust, creating a deep hollow. The landscape is stark, red & spectacular. The night sky is unforgettable.</p>
<p>
On arrival into this remote & rugged region you will be introduced to your hosts - Pat & Sally - at Arkaba Station. Your hosts, Pat and Sally Kent, will ensure a friendly and informal level of attention that is only possible when you are one of a few guests. In a truly Australian way, in a style that is typically 'down to earth' we do not lose sight of the attention to the small details that are so important in the best accommodation.</p>

Sydney, the capital of the state of New South Wales, is Australia's most well known city. With its extraordinary icons both natural and man-made this is a city that never fails to please the eye. It's magnificent natural harbour spanned by the 'coat hanger', the Sydney Harbour Bridge, and the man-made sails of the Sydney Opera House are just some of its most widely photographed views.</p>
<p>
Four Seasons Hotel Sydney Superbly situated right on Sydney Harbour in the city's historic Rocks area, the Four Seasons Sydney Hotel has wonderful views of the Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge. It is only a short walk from Sydney's major shopping and business districts.</p>

<h5>Sydney</h5>
<p>This afternoon you will be orientated with Sydney from the most enviable vantage point - on the water! Cruising on Sydney Harbour is a quintessential Australian experience, and today you will experience 'Calypso' - a 52 foot motor cruiser with a minimum of two and a maximum of ten guests onboard.</p>
<p>
Whilst cruising this iconic harbour you will have the opportunity to swim, fish or kayak. However most choose to sit back with a glass of Australian beer or wine & take in the amazing sights - the Harbour Bridge, the Opera House, Luna Park, Fort Denison and the waterfront homes of the rich & famous. A barbeque lunch is served on board, while anchored in a secluded cove. And as the afternoon sun comes in we suggest making your way to the bow and settling in the sunbeds for the perfect views of the harbour city as you come back in to moor. Your 4 hour experience on the water ends at Campbell's Cove pontoon, just a short walk from your hotel.</p>

Whether this is your first time on safari or a return trip the Serengeti will not disappoint.<br /><br />The Serengeti National Park is arguably the most famous national park in the world. The Serengeti perhaps defines the safari experience as surely as the wildlife that inhabits it. Established in 1951, and covering an area of almost 15,000 sq km, an area comparable to the state of Connecticut or Northern Ireland, the Serengeti hosts a fantastically diverse ecosystem. The principal attraction of the Serengeti is the passing of the wildebeest migration, where 1.5 million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of zebra, gazelle and other plains game that follow close behind, make their way across the plains, stalked by the inevitable predators who make the most of the feast close at hand.<br /></p>";

The Ngorongoro Crater is the largest unbroken caldera in the world and the first sight of it is breathtaking.<br /><br />Ngorongoro Crater Lodge is situated on the edge of the ancient crater rim above the cool, swirling mists. The lodge is a return to the noble elegance of the travelling colonials.

Enjoy an early breakfast before venturing out into Tarangire National Park by 4WD vehicle on exciting morning and afternoon game drives.&nbsp;<br /><br />The appeal of Tarangire National Park lies not only in the herds of migrating animals but also in the beauty of the landscape with its grand baobabs and acacia trees. During the dry season the animals migrate from as far north as Lake Natron, resulting in the resident population of wildebeest, zebra, eland, elephant, hartebeest, buffalo and fringe-eared oryx swelling and competing for Tarangire's permanent water pools.<br /></p>";

This afternoon is at leisure to participate in one of the many activities on offer at your lodge including coffee tasting, guided walks on the estate, bike riding or horse back riding.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Manor at Ngorongoro is reminiscent of an elegant, up country farm home in the Cape Dutch style of architecture. With its 20 luxurious guest cottage suites, this is a luxury safari experience fusing East African safari hospitality with old world Afro-European architecture and d&eacute;cor.<br /></p>";

Descend to the crater floor by 4WD safari vehicle for a game drive unlike any other you will experience in Africa with the forest-covered crater walls rising around you. Enjoy a picnic lunch amongst the hippos and birds before visiting a Maasai village this afternoon.<br /><br />The floor of the crater is only 100 square miles but is home to around 30,000 animals with a high concentration of predators and some of the finest black-maned lions in Africa. Rhinos can be seen with calves at heel. Eland and waterbuck appear not to notice the human visitors, enabling photographers to shoot at ease. On the lake in the middle of the crater you may see thousands of flamingos, fluttering and shimmering like a pink heat haze. Zebra and wildebeest account for almost half the animals - gazelle, buffalo, eland, hartebeest and wart hog can also be seen.<br /></p>";
