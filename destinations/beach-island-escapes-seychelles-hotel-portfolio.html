<dt><h2>DENIS</h2> 
<<<<<<< .mine
<p>Make sure you find time to explore the island which includes a 100-year old lighthouse and densely forested interior. Look out for Toby the tortoise (about the same age as the lighthouse) and the tiny chapel. Tour the gardens and the farm, which ensures the island is more or less self-sufficient. Meal times are a feast of locally grown produce and freshly caught seafood cooked on the open-grill. Or, for a treat, spend an evening dining in the wine cellar. Relaxing days on Denis can be spent sea-fishing, diving, shell-collecting or simply walking on the pristine beach.</p>
<div class="thepet"><p> 25 island-style cottages sit amongst casuarina and coconut trees, bordering the beach. Each has a high woven coconut-grass ceiling and a comfy double bed, romantically draped with mosquito nets and the softest Indian cotton sheets. The private bathroom opens onto a private courtyard. A sitting area is equipped with a mini-fridge, whilst private verandas face the sea. The newly renovated Beach Villa (325 mÂ² in size) has an extended sea facing private deck with an outdoor sitting and dining area. The villa is also has a plunge pool and a sala day bed. If you are travelling with children, the Family Villa has a master bedroom and two additional twin beds.</p>

<dt><h2>BANYAN TREE SEYCHELLES</h2> 
<p>Nestling amongst the swaying palm trees and tropical forest of Intendance Bay, on the main island of Mahe, the Banyan Tree is a romantic hideaway providing a rare taste of paradise. After a day of exploring or lying by the pool, a visit to the Banyan Tree Spa is the ultimate indulgence. Awaken your senses with an invigorating stroll along the beach before breakfast. Once you have worked up an appetite, a delicious spread of fresh fruits, pastries and hot a  la carte dishes awaits. On the Banyan Lagoon I in the company of your personal host and skipper, you can explore the islands of the Seychelles in complete style, stopping whenever you choose for ad hoc lunches, moonlit picnics or a spot of snorkelling. Back on land, a visit to the fabulous spa is an absolute must. All sessions (except beauty & hair treatments) consist of 30 minutes calm time, which includes a footbath before the treatment and a herbal drink served during refreshments & relaxation.</p>
<div class="thepet"><p> 22 Hillside Pool Villas have large bedrooms, a sunken bath and an outside pavilion with living and dining area that leads onto a timber deck with private pool. Four Pool Villas by the Rocks and five Intendance Pool Villas also feature a jet pool, the latter with amazing views of the ocean below. Our favourite for romantic couples are the Beachfront Spa Pool Villas. Each of these has a shower/steam room, larger swimming pool, spa pavilion and outdoor jet pool and shower. But best of all, they also have direct access onto the beach. For families we would recommend the six new Two-Bedroom Double Pool Villas. Just steps from the sand, they come with their own butler, two sprawling master bedrooms, private open-air dining area, two swimming pools and an outdoor jet pool.</p>

<dt><h2>THE OBEROI</h2> 
<p>Sitting on three crescents of soft white sand, overlooking the turquoise waters of the Indian Ocean, The Oberoi Mauritius is surrounded by beautiful subtropical gardens. 20 acres of grounds include fragrant Frangipani trees, African tulip trees, bright red flame trees and an exotic bouquet of bougainvillea, hibiscus and oleander.
</p>
<div class="thepet">
<p>This stylish resort reflects the island's rich multicultural heritage, in tandem with Oberoi's tradition of unparalleled hospitality and legendary service. Treat yourself from top to toe in The Oberoi Spa and float back to your room after enjoying an Ayurvedic or aromatherapy massage. Pick yourself up with a refreshing San Francisco cocktail en route to dinner. Each course at the restaurants resembles a work of art, which tastes as good as it looks. You may find yourself eating a decadent champagne risotto, topped with black truffle, or perhaps a delicately-infused snapper, freshly caught that day.</p>
<p>The sugar-cane thatched Pavilions and Villas are decorated in beige and cream, with furnishings from Africa and Bali.
