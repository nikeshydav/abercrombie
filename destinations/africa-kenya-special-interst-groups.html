<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<ul class="itinerarylist">
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong>  8 days</p>
<p>This special interest programme provides fascinating insight into Kenya and its people, and includes visits to a school, a Maasai village and a number of conservation projects.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong> Nairobi, Ol Pejeta Conservancy, Samburu, Masai Mara. </p>
</li>
<li><h4>Day 1</h4>
<h5>Arrive Nairobi </h5>
<p>This morning arrive at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. After clearing immigration and customs formalities you will be transferred to the Serena Hotel.</p>
<p>Spend the rest of the day relaxing or sightseeing. There are various options for sightseeing depending on the time you have. Some of the places you could visit are:</p>
<p>The Karen Blixen Museum: once part of Karen Blixen's vast coffee estate, 'Mbogani' was Karen's home from 1917 until 1931. The house and grounds were made famous by the film Out of Africa and have been restored by the Danish community of Kenya. Visitors have a glimpse of typical colonial life in Kenya at the turn of the 20th century.</p>
<p>The Giraffe Centre: the headquarters for AFEW, the African Fund for Endangered Wildlife. Made famous by Daisy Rothschild, a giraffe calf rescued from Soi. The Giraffe Centre was established in 1983 and the breeding programme has been a great success. Visitors can watch these gentle giants at eye level from a raised platform and hand-feed them.</p>
<p>David Sheldrick's: Daphne, the widow of pioneer wildlife ranger David Sheldrick, set up this orphanage on the edge of Nairobi National Park to successfully raise orphaned wild animals (mainly elephant and rhino) and reintroduce them into the wild. It is important to note that entrance is usually between 11.00 am and noon when the animals come to the waterhole and are bottle fed with milk.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Serena Hotel<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> </p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<h5>Nairobi - Ol Pejeta Conservancy</h5>
<p>This morning your guide will give a short safari briefing before you begin your drive through rich farming lands towards the foothills of Mount Kenya. Your destination is the private Ol Pejeta Conservancy which is one of Kenya's leading conservation successes.</p>
<p>Continue your drive and arrive at Sweetwaters Tented Camp in time for lunch. Sweetwaters is a sheltered oasis, clustered around a waterhole. All tents face a waterhole which is set in the shadows of Mount Kenya. A cleverly hidden electric fence prevents animals from entering the grounds but allows for a wonderful experience of being close to game without any danger.</p>
<p>Both night and day game drives allow guests to explore the sanctuary, whilst interpretive bush walks offer the chance to learn the signs of the bush. Horse and camel riding are also offered. One of the highlights here is a visit to the Chimpanzee Sanctuary where chimpanzees rescued from traumatic situations are being carefully nursed back to health so they can enjoy the rest of their days in the safety of a vast natural enclosure. This is the only place in Kenya to see these intelligent animals</p>
<p>After lunch there is time to relax, you can spend time by the pool or observing game at the waterhole, before your afternoon game viewing drive and visit to the Chimp Sanctuary.</p>
<p>Return to camp for dinner.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Sweetwaters Tented Camp <br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D </p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
<h5>Ol Pejeta Conservancy - Samburu</h5>
<p>After a hearty breakfast, drive to Nanyuki and make a stop at the Nanyuki Spinners &amp; Weavers, which is a women's self-help project started in 1977 in the highlands area around Nanyuki. The project was started with the aim of training poor widowed and single women to spin and weave sheep's wool on handlooms and sell the rugs and blankets they made to generate income for their families and at the same time become self-reliant. Over 282 women have been trained at the centre to date and some women have even started their own projects in other parts of the country, while others sell spun yarn to weavers and knitters to form sister groups. Spend time at the centre, talk to the women and learn how this project has changed their lives.</p>
<p>Continue further north to Samburu, a harsh, savagely beautiful wilderness that depends on the steady flow of the Uaso Nyiro River for its existence.</p><br />
<p>Arrive at Samburu Intrepids in time for lunch. Perched on the banks of the Uaso Nyiro River in the arid wilderness of Samburu National Park, Samburu Intrepids has long been a popular base for exploring the ancient wilds of Kenya's northern frontier.The tents offer simple but luxurious accommodation, with large four-poster beds, modern bathrooms, and secluded balconies overlooking the riverbanks where elephant and buffalo regularly come to drink. The acclaimed Adventurers' Club offers an innovative array of educational games and activities for younger visitors.</p>
<p>Relax after lunch before departing for a game viewing drive in the reserve. This evening, before dinner, a Samburu warrior will give a talk and slide show on the Samburu tribe, their culture and traditional way of life which they still practice today.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Samburu Intepids<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D  </p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 4</h4>
<h5>Samburu</h5>
<p>Full day to explore Samburu.</p>
<p>The river waters a wide variety of animal species not found south of the equator, including the majestic Beisa oryx, the reticulated giraffe, the thin-striped Grevy's zebra, and the 'giraffe-necked' gerenuk antelope which stands on its hind legs to feed. Elephant, buffalo, lion and leopard can all be seen along the river, and the 400-plus species of birds are positively spectacular.</p>
<p>Samburu, Buffalo Springs and Shaba national reserve are adjacent to each other and lie within the lands of the Samburu tribe. The Samburu, like the Maasai, live a nomadic, cattle-herding existence, with strict adherence to their age-old rites and customs.</p>
<p>You will also visit the school in a nearby village where you will donate some school supplies and spend time singing with the children and chatting with the teachers.</p>
<p>Your game viewing drive ends with one of Kenya's oldest traditions - a sundowner. Take in the rapid sunset which transforms the world in a matter of minutes. As the sun begins to set, relax and enjoy a drink and the warmth of the fire as you watch the spectacular setting sun on the horizon.</p>
<p>Before dinner come together for a drink and a discussion with your guide on the different tribes in Kenya. Many people forget that there are over 40 ethnic groups in Kenya and your guide will be able to tell you about the different cultures and the role of the different ethnic groups in Kenya.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Samburu Intrepids<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D  </p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 5</h4>
<h5>Masai Mara</h5>
<p>This morning, after breakfast, transfer to the airstrip for your flight to the famous Masai Mara.</p>
<p>On arrival in the Mara your driver guide will be waiting and you will be transferred to the camp.</p>
<p>Sheltered in a shady indigenous forest on a broad sweep of the Talek River, Mara Intrepids is a delightful camp. The tents are arranged in small clusters along the river banks and are a picture of old-world elegance, with large four-poster beds and elegant furniture. All tents have modern en suite bathrooms with flush toilets. The camp's amiable staff will pamper to your every need, while the very knowledgeable guides offer game drives and walking safaris. The acclaimed Adventurers' Club offers an innovative array of educational games and activities for younger visitors.</p>
<p>After lunch, venture out for a game viewing drive.</p>
<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Mara Intrepids<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D  </p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 6</h4>
<h5>Masai Mara</h5>
<p>Two full days to enjoy the splendours of the Maasai Mara.</p>
<p>The jewel in Africa's crown, the Masai Mara is host to the most spectacular array of wildlife. Her open savannah, woodlands and tree-lined rivers create an eco-system which supports huge numbers of bird and mammal species. Lion are found in abundance throughout the park as are elephant, giraffe, a variety of gazelle species and zebra. Cheetah and leopard are also regularly seen and, if lucky, you may also spot rhino. The annual wildebeest migration traditionally is present in the Mara from July to September and at this time nature's dramas unfold before your very eyes. As well as wildlife, the Masai Mara is also home to many members of the colourful Maasai tribe.</p>
<p>On one of these days you will visit a Maasai Village, where the village elder will invite you to learn about the Maasai culture in a relaxed and friendly atmosphere. The Maasai still live a very traditional lifestyle and they will talk to you about the medicinal uses of the trees and herbs in the area, the social structure of the homestead, the role of women in their society and other aspects of their daily life. Interaction and discussion is encouraged and often guests join in the dance or try to learn how to make fire using sticks and stone.</p>
<p>You will also spend an afternoon with one of the field staff from Friends of Conservation, an organisation committed to working with local communities to develop and promote a balance between their needs and those of the wildlife with which they share the natural habitat.</p>
<p>There are also options for a morning balloon safari or a half-day visit to Lake Victoria.</p>
<p>Balloon Safari: As the balloon is inflated against the first rays of sunrise your pilot will go through safety procedures. Once aloft, the balloon floats gently over the plains, giving a bird's eye view of the game below as the sun creeps slowly over the horizon. After around one hour the balloon lands and nearby breakfast is already being prepared and, of course, glasses of bubbly to toast your flight in a tradition initiated by the Montgolfier brothers. </p>
<p>Lake Victoria Adventure : An early start this morning with a transfer to take you to the airstrip for a flight by light aircraft to Lake Victoria. On arrival enjoy an appetising full English breakfast before you board the boat for the morning. There will be the opportunity to try fishing for the legendary giant Nile perch found in these waters as you explore the myriad of tiny islands in this region of the lake. An experienced and knowledgeable fisherman captains each boat. There is the chance to stop at a traditional fishing village and see how the villagers live from day to day before returning to the airstrip for your return flight to the Masai Mara.</p>

The house and grounds were made famous by the film <em>Out of Africa</em> and have been restored by the Danish community of Kenya. Visitors have a glimpse of typical colonial life in Kenya at the turn of the 20th century.<br /><br />The Giraffe Centre: the headquarters for AFEW, the African Fund for Endangered Wildlife. Made famous by Daisy Rothschild, a giraffe calf rescued from Soi. The Giraffe Centre was established in 1983 and the breeding programme has been a great success. Visitors can watch these gentle giants at eye level from a raised platform and hand-feed them.<br /><br />David Sheldrick's: Daphne, the widow of pioneer wildlife ranger David Sheldrick, set up this orphanage on the edge of Nairobi National Park to successfully raise orphaned wild animals (mainly elephant and rhino) and reintroduce them into the wild. It is important to note that entrance is usually between 11.00 am and noon when the animals come to the waterhole and are bottle fed with milk.<br /></p>";

A cleverly hidden electric fence prevents animals from entering the grounds but allows for a wonderful experience of being close to game without any danger.<br /><br />Both night and day game drives allow guests to explore the sanctuary, whilst interpretive bush walks offer the chance to learn the signs of the bush. Horse and camel riding are also offered. One of the highlights here is a visit to the Chimpanzee Sanctuary where chimpanzees rescued from traumatic situations are being carefully nursed back to health so they can enjoy the rest of their days in the safety of a vast natural enclosure. This is the only place in Kenya to see these intelligent animals<br /><br />After lunch there is time to relax, you can spend time by the pool or observing game at the waterhole, before your afternoon game viewing drive and visit to the Chimp Sanctuary.<br /><br />Return to camp for dinner.<br /></p>";

The project was started with the aim of training poor widowed and single women to spin and weave sheep's wool on handlooms and sell the rugs and blankets they made to generate income for their families and at the same time become self-reliant. Over 282 women have been trained at the centre to date and some women have even started their own projects in other parts of the country, while others sell spun yarn to weavers and knitters to form sister groups. Spend time at the centre, talk to the women and learn how this project has changed their lives.<br /><br />Continue further north to Samburu, a harsh, savagely beautiful wilderness that depends on the steady flow of the Uaso Nyiro River for its existence.<br /><br />Arrive at Samburu Intrepids in time for lunch. Perched on the banks of the Uaso Nyiro River in the arid wilderness of Samburu National Park, Samburu Intrepids has long been a popular base for exploring the ancient wilds of Kenya's northern frontier.The tents offer simple but luxurious accommodation, with large four-poster beds, modern bathrooms, and secluded balconies overlooking the riverbanks where elephant and buffalo regularly come to drink. The acclaimed Adventurers' Club offers an innovative array of educational games and activities for younger visitors.<br /><br />Relax after lunch before departing for a game viewing drive in the reserve.

<p>Nakuru is also home to some of East Africa's rarest creatures, including fast-growing populations of black and white rhino, the endangered Rothschild's giraffe, buffalo, waterbuck and lion.</p>
<p>Lake Nakuru enjoys a reputation as one of the best places in the country to spot the elusive leopard.</p>
<p>For the photographer, in addition to the amazing wildlife and birdlife, the park offers a diversity of landscapes from the beautiful wooded and bush grasslands around the soda lake, to rocky escarpments and clusters of yellow thorn acacias under carpets of beautiful green grass.</p>

<p><strong>Overnight:</strong> Sarova Mara Camp<br />
<strong>Meal Plan:</strong> B,L,D  </p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Day 7</h4>
<h5>Masai Mara </h5>
<p>You have the next two days to enjoy game viewing as you venture out into the park led by your driver/guide.</p>
<p>The Mara is a photographer's dream, the wildlife is abundant and the swaying grasslands ensure that animals are never out of sight. Elephants browse amongst the large herds of wildebeest and topi, gazelle, eland and buffalo. The plains offer a rich variety of food for the dominant predators: lion; leopard; hyena and cheetah. In the Mara River, hippos submerge to snort and grumble while crocodiles sunbathe on the riverbanks. Between July and September, rain depending, the Masai Mara is host to the famous wildebeest migration which is one of the few remaining mass migrations of mammals in the world. During this time herds of over a million wildebeest will trawl their way through this region and they become the major focus for predatory activity as drama unfolds at every corner.</p>
<p>On one of these days we will visit a Maasai village, where the village elder will invite you to learn about the Maasai culture in a relaxed and friendly atmosphere. The Maasai still live a very traditional lifestyle and they will talk to you about the medicinal uses of the trees and herbs in the area, the social structure of the homestead, the role of women in their society and other aspects of their daily life. Interaction and discussion is encouraged and often guests join in the dance or try to learn how to make fire using sticks and stone.</p>
<p>There are also options for a morning balloon safari or a half-day visit to Lake Victoria.</p>
<p>Balloon Safari: As the balloon is inflated against the first rays of sunrise your pilot will go through safety procedures. Once aloft, the balloon floats gently over the plains, giving a bird's eye view of the game below as the sun creeps slowly over the horizon. After around one hour the balloon lands and nearby breakfast is already being prepared and, of course, glasses of bubbly to toast your flight in a tradition initiated by the Montgolfier brothers</p>
<p>Lake Victoria Adventure: An early start this morning with a transfer to take you to the airstrip for a flight by light aircraft to Lake Victoria. On arrival enjoy an appetising full English breakfast before you board the boat for the morning. There will be the opportunity to try fishing for the legendary giant Nile perch found in these waters as you explore the myriad of tiny islands in this region of the lake. An experienced and knowledgeable fisherman captains each boat.

Elephants browse amongst the large herds of wildebeest and topi, gazelle, eland and buffalo. The plains offer a rich variety of food for the dominant predators: lion; leopard; hyena and cheetah. In the Mara River, hippos submerge to snort and grumble while crocodiles sunbathe on the riverbanks. Between July and September, rain depending, the Masai Mara is host to the famous wildebeest migration which is one of the few remaining mass migrations of mammals in the world. During this time herds of over a million wildebeest will trawl their way through this region and they become the major focus for predatory activity as drama unfolds at every corner.</p>
<p>On one of these days we will visit a Maasai village, where the village elder will invite you to learn about the Maasai culture in a relaxed and friendly atmosphere. The Maasai still live a very traditional lifestyle and they will talk to you about the medicinal uses of the trees and herbs in the area, the social structure of the homestead, the role of women in their society and other aspects of their daily life. Interaction and discussion is encouraged and often guests join in the dance or try to learn how to make fire using sticks and stone.</p>
<p>There are also options for a morning balloon safari or a half-day visit to Lake Victoria.</p>
<p>Balloon Safari: As the balloon is inflated against the first rays of sunrise your pilot will go through safety procedures. Once aloft, the balloon floats gently over the plains, giving a bird's eye view of the game below as the sun creeps slowly over the horizon. After around one hour the balloon lands and nearby breakfast is already being prepared and, of course, glasses of bubbly to toast your flight in a tradition initiated by the Montgolfier brothers</p>
<p>Lake Victoria Adventure: An early start this morning with a transfer to take you to the airstrip for a flight by light aircraft to Lake Victoria. On arrival enjoy an appetising full English breakfast before you board the boat for the morning. There will be the opportunity to try fishing for the legendary giant Nile perch found in these waters as you explore the myriad of tiny islands in this region of the lake. An experienced and knowledgeable fisherman captains each boat. There is the chance to stop at a traditional fishing village and see how the villagers live from day to day before returning to the airstrip for your return flight to the Masai Mara.</p>
